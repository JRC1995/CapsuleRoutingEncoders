Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L> said it had agreed in principle to buy <I P Sharp Associates Ltd> of Toronto for 30.4 mln stg. Sharp is a time-sharing network and database company specialising in finance, economics, energy and aviation. It operates a global packet-switching network and global limits systems for foreign exchange trading. Sharp shareholders will be offered cash, shares or a mixture of the two in settlement. The acquisition, which is subject to Canadian government approval, would be through amalgamation into a specially-created company. Reuters said it had been given options by a number of Sharp shareholders covering 67 pct of the common stock pending completion of a Reuters review of the company. Sharp operates 38 offices in 20 countries. In 1986 it reported revenue of 55 mln Canadian dlrs with a pretax loss of 1.6 mln compared with a 1.9 mln profit in 1985. However, Sharp said that internal accounts showed the company was in profit in the first two months of 1987. End-1986 net assets totalled 11.85 mln dlrs. A Reuters statement said the acquisition would fit perfectly into its package for the banking and securities industries. Reuter 

Senate Banking Committee chairman William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.

"A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and investment banking," Proxmire said. He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts were hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executives who tesitified at the hearing. "I believe that takeovers have become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial buccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairman David Roderick said. "For Congress to allow the takeover game to continue unchecked, would be economic suicide," Champion International Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added. Reuter 

Owners of two aluminum smelters in Kentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates after a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate hike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky. But the owners of the smelters, (National Southwire Aluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd <AL>, said further viability of the operations would depend in part upon how the rate case is eventually settled. "We're hoping for no rate increases but we can't say for sure. It's still possible we'll have to close the smelter," a National Southwire spokesman said. He said there were other variables to consider in any decision whether to close or continue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 miles west of Louisville. National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc <NII>, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), which holds the rest, the spokesman said. A spokesman for Montreal-based Alcan said, "The decision is 48 pages long and is in legal-ese, so it certainly will be a long time before we can make a decision" about what it means for the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west of Louisville. "But we're delighted that Big Rivers Electric was denied the requested rate increase." A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generates and wholesales electricity to four distributors, said the requested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates. The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying the increase, asked the utility to meet with creditors, which include Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and Irving Bank Corp <V>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utility spokesman said. The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out a flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index their electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said. "We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, to assure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable," he said. No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned between the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plant owners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for July 28. Reuter 

The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd <SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd <EVGH.HK> group, stock brokers said. They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's <China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels." Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. <Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake. "It is purely coincidence," he said. But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles. "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who asked not to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price. Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and the group's associate <Chinese Estates Ltd>. Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday, China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs. REUTER 

Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to today." Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous." "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein." "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing." Reuter 

U.K. Officials are studying the possible link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a Ministry of Agriculture official said.

The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of salmonella. "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible effects on human and animal health," the official said. The government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves under 56 days old through markets.

"We expect to file papers late tonight" asking the ICC to reopen the rail merger case, spokesman Rich Hall said in a telephone interview from the company's Chicago headquarters. The ICC had rejected in July, on grounds it would reduce competition, the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads. The deadline for seeking ICC reconsideration of the merger plan is midnight tonight. Santa Fe Southern Pacific owns the Santa Fe railroad and holds the Southern Pacific railroad assets in trust while awaiting federal approval of the merger plan. The ICC had ordered the holding company to divest one or the other railroad but stayed its ruling pending a decision on the request for reconsideration. If the ICC ultimately decides not to reopen the case, it is expected to reinstate the divestiture order. Reuter 

Eastman Kodak Co said it has acquired an 18.7 pct equity interest in Enzon Inc, a pharmaceutical company specializing in protein therapy. Kodak said it secured worldwide marketing rights for three of Enzon's PEG enzymes used in the treatment of oxygen toxicity disorders, hyperuricemia and gout. The company said it acquired two mln Enzon shares for 15 mln dlrs, with loans to Enzon of two mln dlrs and interest of 30,000 dlrs credited against the purchase price. Kodak said the drugs covered by the marketing rights are in initial stages of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process. It said the investment should provide the necessary capital to complete the FDA review process and provide a marketing outlet for the drugs. The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase, for use against oxygen toxicity disorders that cause the often-fatal tissue damage associated with severe burns, organ transplants, heart attacks and trauma, and PEG-uricase, for treatment of gout and other conditions caused by the buildup of high levels of uric acid in the body.

The Dutch central bank announced new eleven-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct to aid money market liquidity, covering the period March 9 to 20. The amount will be set at tender on Monday March 9 between 0800 and 0830 GMT. The new facility will replace the current 4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday. Money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11 to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday.

Sulpetro also recorded a writeoff of deferred charges amounting to 67.0 mln dlrs, a loss of 22.5 mln dlrs on the disposal of all properties in the United Kingdom and an equity loss of 21.2 mln dlrs from affiliate Sulbath Exploration Ltd. There was also a loss on other investments of 4.6 mln dlrs and a loss on operations of 36.1 mln dlrs after interest, depletion, depreciation and income tax recoveries. In the fiscal year ended October 31, 1985, Sulpetro had a net loss of 45.6 mln dlrs, or 3.90 dlrs per share.

GAF Corp said it has made an all cash merger proposal to Borg-Warner Corp at 46 dlrs per share for all the company's common stock. Following a meeting yesterday with Borg-Warner officials and investment bankers, GAF said, it is today delivering a letter to the Borg-Warner board outling the terms of the proposal that would be made by tender offer, pursuant to a mutually acceptable merger agreement to be approved by the Borg-Warner board and conditioned on that board's recommendation of the tender offer and merger. GAF, in its letter, stated it intends to finance the proposed acquisition entirely with its own funds and bank borrowings under a syndicated bank loan from a group of banks led by Chase Manhattan Corp's <CMB> Chase Manhattan Bank. Last week, GAF increased its ownership of Borg-Warner shares to 19.9 pct of those outstanding Minstar Inc <MNST> sold its 12.4 pct holding. GAF emphasized "the amicable nature of the proposed transaction," which it characterized as a partnership. GAF said it wanted to discuss with the Borg-Warner board key roles for Borg-Warner's senior management in the new organization, board representation for Borg-Warner directors on a newly constituted board, and a company name change. GAF said it will be filing an amendment to its 13-D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Borg-Warner has about 85.6 mln common shares outstanding. Minstar chairman Irwin L. Jacobs sold his stake after Borg-Warner after the company failed to respond to his mid-February offer for a negotiated agreement at a minimum price of 44 dlrs a share. In November, Jacobs had offered to enter into acquisition talks with Borg-Warner based on a price of between 43 and 48 dlrs a share. Reuter 

There has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement, INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said. "There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet," he said. The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may sell") and "must buy" (or "must sell") levels without changing the "lower indicative price" (or floor price) of 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five-day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price, set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo, and of the "lower indicative price" if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact. Reuter 

The Great Northern Nekoosa Corp said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common stock split. The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's Great Southern Paper division operations. In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the company said. The company said it will propose an increase in its dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June payment. The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct higher than the current rate. The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said. As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN common stock outstanding, according to the company. Reuter 

Heavy buying by speculators boosted Conrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29, higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc <IV>. "It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria," said one arbitrageur, referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per share and ended when ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> found a white knight willing to bid 36.50 dlrs. For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed like an "appropriate price." Another said "it's too early to project the outcome." "The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr offer is inadequate," the second arbitrageur said. But he added it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today. He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is able to thwart Mark IV. Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it would make a recommendation by April 17. A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a determined bidder. "They're not beginners," he said. Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find another buyer. "It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses," he said. "There is only a small universe of people who would want to own the company as it's presently structured." Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software, aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding equipment and other products. "I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for those who can take the risk," said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at Milwaukee Co. He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV "fair value but on the low side." "I don't think management was looking for a buyer in any way before this offer," he said. Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche markets. He said management has done a good job of turning around the telephone answering machine business. Reuter 

The gold mining industry had another "exceptional year" in 1986 with tonnage milled, revenues and profits reaching high levels, the Chamber of Mines said. Nearly 108 mln tons of ore was milled, three pct higher than the prior year, while revenues rose 17 pct to 16.5 billion rand and profits increased 6.5 pct to 8.31 billion rand, the Chamber reported. The profit rise was achieved despite substantial cost increases and a 26.1 pct rise in capital expenditures to 2.42 billion rand, it said. The chamber said that a "comparatively buoyant gold price allowed mines to continue the practise of mining lower grade ores which has characterised recent years." It said the industry now mines to an average grade of 5.63 grams per ton compared with 6.09 grams per ton in 1985. Gold output for the year declined five pct to 638 tons compared with the previous year's 671 tons. REUTER 

A spokesman for Preussag AG <PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985. Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board. The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group's other divisions. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions. Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before. The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln. The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector. The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results. Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year. Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG. Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures. Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes. Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year. AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year. REUTER 

Britain's gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 1.785 billion dlrs in March after a 287 mln dlr rise in January, the Treasury said. This was considerably above market expectations for a 650 mln dlr rise. The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments. The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Last month it said the Bank of England took the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn. Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305 mln in February, to 22.26 billion. Total reserves were revalued to 27.04 billion dlrs, but would have totalled 24.15 billion under the previous valuation, the Treasury said. Gold reserves were revalued by 895 mln dlrs, while SDRs, ECU and convertible currency holdings were revalued by 1.995 billion.

Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that the U.S.'s main industrial partners should expand their domestic growth. In a speech to a women's group here, Johnson said, "There is room for stronger domestic growth in those countries ... strong enough to absorb growth in U.S. export markets." Johnson also said there was a better alignment of exchange rates now and the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies has brought western nations a long way towards establishing that goal. Johnson said, "The Fed supports this pattern of exchange rates ... and we'll see if it leads to a convergence in trade. Quite possibly it can be achieved." Johnson said the Paris agreement achieved a better alignment of exchange rates in exchange for stimulus by the major surplus countries. He said this was "a major improvement and a step in the right direction" and added U.S. allies look very strongly to a U.S. budget deficit cut. "There will always be a potential risk of breakdown in international cooperation" without a budget deficit cut. Reuter 

Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia"s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks. "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain," the report says. "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels." Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump. REUTER 

International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman Lindenberg Sette said. The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the meeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive board's regular session this week has so far been confined to routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to revive export quota negotiations, delegates said. Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how quotas should be allocated. Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among producers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most countries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual September council session to restart negotiations. Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for today's producer meeting to exchange views on the market situation, the producer delegates said. The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices in London and New York futures, traders said. Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at 1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said. The executive board session looks set to end today, following a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when a consultancy report of the operation of the ICO will be presented to producers and consumers, delegates added.

Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS>, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years. Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's guilder value, van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said <Balanced Foods> and <Green's Dairy>, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said. The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in foreign hands. The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating. Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. REUTER 

Japan is doing all it can to solve its trade problems with the United States but the two nations will remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in Japan's favour, a senior official said. "So long as there is an external imbalance there will be trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments," the Foreign Ministry official told reporters. Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon. Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the spectre of a trade war between the two countries. "We take the current situation very seriously," said the official, who declined to be identified. "The basic stance of the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all available resources." The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer microchips in world markets and to try to import more American semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges. The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs in the middle of this month. But he said that any response would be in accordance with international law and Japan's international obligations. He added that both Japan and the United States must take account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the world economy. REUTER 

The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers. "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination," the SEC said. Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days. Reuter 

Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules, delegates said. While consumers do not yet have a common position, an observer said after a consumer meeting, "They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive." European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect, delegates said. At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules. The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month's meeting. The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said. The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa, delegates said. A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question. A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a consumer meeting. Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon. "We are waiting to see what consumers say," a producer delegate said. "We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate." The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non- members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an increasingly important producer. Reuter 

National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year's severe trade deficit with the West. Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade. "It is useful to have a devaluation," he said. "There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports." The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow. He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986). This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added. Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year. But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985. Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs. One Western commercial attache here said: "Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods." Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry. It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market. Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen. He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation. "I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said. "I am against credits for consumption." He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986. Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low. Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.

First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is attainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because ... they're going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies," Walsh said. Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview. He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990. Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank. Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking. The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980, Cornelissen said. Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co <DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies. "It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up." Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services. He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations "before the end of this month" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal. "The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "we don't think the international markets are well-served." Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad, Cornelissen said. Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust. Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we had to be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities." Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units, Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks. "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.," said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years." He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.

Alcoa officials acknowledged the possibility that they may have a position in the off-exchange aluminum options market, but declined specific comment on trade speculation that the company is holding a large outstanding position. An Alcoa (Aluminum Company of America) source involved in terminal trading for the company said: "We use all means available to manage our business, so it's a possibility we're trading options." "We won't go into specifics about what we're doing. But when you're dealing in un-alloyed ingot, it's a commodity business where there are a lot of tools available (for hedging) and Alcoa is using all of those tools," said Al Posti, Alcoa's manager of corporate news. Trade sources have said Alcoa is long call options equal to 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes of aluminum due to mature in April and May. However, some New York-based aluminium traders said they believe the size of Alcoa's position has been exaggerated. The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one factor indicating that supply tightness may worsen in the second quarter, traders said. "If they decide to exercise their right to buy, it would mean really squeezing the market," one New York trader said, noting that aluminum stocks on the London Metal Exchange were 90,500 tonnes at the end of last week.

Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. "But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future," Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said. "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant," he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report. "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. "The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected," Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more," Maciej said.

Pyongyang and a group of Tokyo-based North Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Korean goldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two years from 600 pounds at present, said Li Sangsu, a spokesman for <Unzan Mine Development Co>, the venture partner. Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70 billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added. "We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen in gold deposits," he said. The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles north of Pyongyang, Li said. Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would increase yields. "Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated methods and basic equipment." The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors. Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off part of its debt with several tonnes of fish. REUTER 

French Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond predicted in a published interview a successful end to negotiations to admit Gulf petrochemical exports into the European Community (EC). Negotiations have been under way between the Community and the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for three years. Raimond, due here tomorrow from Oman for his first official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), told the semi-official daily Al-Ittihad he was confident a solution would soon be reached. "I am confident that problems between the two big partners, the GCC and the EC, will find a solution. I will work to reach that solution," he said in the interview conducted in Paris. An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical exports over a set quota has strained trade relations between the two sides. GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on European exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached. Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a long time because there were 20 countries involved. But added: "Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for making crucial progress." Referring to the Iran-Iraq war, he said efforts should continue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties. He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran. Some problems were solved as a result of the contacts while others remained unresolved. He gave no details but said: "France wishes to have normal relations with Iran." REUTER 

General Public Utilities Corp said the water-clarity problem delaying the removal of fuel from the damaged Unit Two of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant appears to have been resolved. The company said the slower than expected removal of the fuel, which has been primarily due to the water-clarity problems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988. A spokesman said the company had previously expected this to be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how far into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects to complete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added. GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualified its opinion of GPU's financial statements, adding the recovery of TMI-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading to the qualified opinion. GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recover the costs of decommissioning TMI-2 in future rate proceedings.

Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.90 mln bpd, up 1.4 pct from 11.74 mln a year earlier, it said. In the first 78 days of the year, refinery runs were up 1.8 pct to an average 12.25 mln bpd from 12.04 mln in the year-ago period, the EIA said. Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged 16.32 mln bpd, up 1.8 pct from 16.04 mln in 1986, it said. So far this year, distillate demand rose 0.1 pct to 3.31 mln bpd from 3.30 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.60 mln bpd, up 0.1 pct from 6.59 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 0.4 pct to 1.42 mln bpd from 1.43 mln, the EIA said.

The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday. "Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday," a consumer delegate said. "The atmosphere is excellent." Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1, if the rules are agreed by Friday. A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a "very interesting stage of negotiations," delegates said. The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates. Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow. Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said. The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said. The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council. Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said. The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added. One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is "transparency," meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible, delegates said. After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism, they said. Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn, delegates said. The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed. Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules, producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices, delegates said.

Amoco Corp said its WEQB-1 exploratory well 39 miles east of Galeota Point on Trinidad's east coast flowed 24 mln cubic feet of natural gas and 500 barrels of condensate daily from one zone and 29 mln cubic feet of natural gas and 600 barrels of condensate daily from a second. The company said both flows were through 40/64 inch chokes and from zones between 10,000 and 13,000 feet in depth. The well, in 260 feet of water, was drilled to a total depth of 14,629 feet, it said. It said the discovery was made in sands previously untested in the area. Reuter 

Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets. Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that "we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding" on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels. He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint currency float - but one which let it still purse an independent monetary policy. "I would concede that, since the Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something," Leigh-Pemberton said. "The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together" towards stabilising exchange rates," Leigh-Pemberton said. He did not mention this week's intervention by central banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the accord. Leigh-Pemberton said that "the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days" before September 1985. He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing." He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing." Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower, he said "the two half point cuts (this month in banks' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now." Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a "cautious step-by-step approach" to reducing short term interest rates, not least because "we have a potential problem with inflation." Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, "one of the highest" among industrialised nations, he added. Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct. Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall. He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling index, when compared with the index's level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975, closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close. Reuter 

The Bank of France intervened in the Paris foreign exchange market this morning for the third successive day, banking sources said. Like yesterday, it bought dollars and sold yen in small amounts, they said. One dealer said it was seen in the market twice in early dealing, buying five mln dlrs each time. Other dealers also reported small-scale intervention to stabilise the dollar after aggressive selling overnight in Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan also intervened again. The dollar steadied at around 6.0650/0700 francs after easing in early trading to 6.0615/35 from an opening 6.0700/50. It closed yesterday at 6.0800/30. One major french bank said it bought 10 mln dlrs for the central bank, selling yen, within a trading range of 148.20/30 yen to the dollar, compared with yesterday's 149.28 rate at which intervention was carried out here. The yen later firmed to around 147.90/148.00. Reuter 

Great American Corp said preliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANK subsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mln dlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs. The charge will be made against the allowance for possible loan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate. Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular examination and a final report is not expected for several weeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedown in response to the preliminary findings. Great American said regulatory authorities are not requiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial results for Great American for 1986. However, Great American has revised its previous estimates of provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to the allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it took the action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its allowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment does not show signs for significant improvement in the near future. It said the additional provision increases the allowance to 26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan portfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end. Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth quarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to a net loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the year earlier. Reuter 

The Agriculture Department must make a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the government and foreign soybean production will increase, the president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said. "The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another ... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as much as they want, but they have to eventually address this problem," David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters. USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the soybean loan, Haggard said. "I don't know if USDA is really very serious about addressing the soybean loan problem," he said. At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA leaders refused to change their official position on the loan -- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs. The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a 5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment. Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed proposals have but said, "in all honesty, we do not want to see the farm bill be torn apart." He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could change the loan without new legislation. Making the loan partially in certificates which would not have to be paid back would be one option, he said. Reuter 

The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks to moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said. A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week the Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors, but he declined to say whether this was aimed at moderating the dollar sales. Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry monitoring. One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing with the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of the market. A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of the survey as long it was not used too forcefully. But another official denied local press reports that the central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their dollar sales. "We are not legally authorized to do that," he said. A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such investments threaten to cause inflation. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously expressed concern about excessive investment in land and securities resulting partly from eased credit conditions. REUTER 

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now.

The Philippines' Social Security System (SSS) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer <San Miguel Corp> (SMC), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del Rosario said. He told reporters the government organisation had expressed interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a share. The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) and sequestered by the government. The block is split between class A and class B stock. SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N. Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres Soriano, del Rosario said. The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices. Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to unidentified foreign purchasers. He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares. President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the shares. Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on Good Government. The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.

U.S. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said. "People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains. The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume, he noted. "We've had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people's viewpoints on interest rates," Mains said. The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for "less than ebullient market action," Mains said. He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range. "My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified," Mains said. Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest. "All of the movement occurs at the opening," afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said. Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January retail sales and industrial production were "not real exciting," said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. "There is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment," Leiner said. Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market, said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan. Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month. Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed the largest increase since 1979. "The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal," Kahan said. He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth. If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said. Reuter 

Corporate raider Carl Icahn acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible violations of securities laws. Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc <TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group. The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing. The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws and related rules, Icahn said. Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies, he said. Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days. Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated. By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA. It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders. Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company's stock. SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to published reports. Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making no filing at all could indicate a scheme to "warehouse" shares of stock. In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in concert would each amass stock in the company without disclosing that they have an agreement among them. By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert. Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc. Reuter 

The Bank of France said it invited offers of first category paper today for a money market intervention tender. Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for the Bank to cut its intervention rate at the tender by a quarter percentage point to 7-3/4 pct from eight, reflecting an easing in call money rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.

Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for USAir Group <U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc, which was being courted by USAir. Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc <TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to accepting the bid. Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged. "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will succeed. Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk Southern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the least likely to be bought. Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies. Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. "You can't discount him," said one arbitrager. Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer. "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," said one arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately. "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work," said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity, analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work. However, other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA. Reuter 

Asked what the U.S. State Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market. "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market," Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers. "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't," he said. "That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets, and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm program and try to figure out what we should do to make it better," Shultz told the Wheat Growers. Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the American housewife, he realizes the importance of American agricultural products being competitively priced. Speculation has been in the market for some time that the United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices. Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials have declined to take any official position on the issue. Reuter 

Kloeckner & Co KGaA, the international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves. The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985. It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices. Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar. It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations. Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct.

"We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above those of the plateau years," he said, referring to the four years up to 1985. "In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position and improved on it," Holden-Brown said. Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a 49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement. Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983, 294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' financial results for the fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months of Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provide actual figures. He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham's profit improvement in the current year will come from a previously announced reorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a close partnership with Allied-Lyons' existing Allied Vintners division.

Bank Negara said although Malaysia's net borrowing dropped in 1986, its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is pegged. The basket comprises principally the U.S. Dollar, yen, mark, Swiss franc, French franc, sterling, guilder, Canadian and Singapore dollars, it added.

Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said he expects the country's 1986/87 current account deficit to be one billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in the August budget. Keating told a financiers' dinner that February's 750 mln dlr deficit, against January's 1.23 billion, was "in the groove" of the government's expectations. "We will probably bring the current account this year under 14 billion, I think, which will probably be about a billion dollars less than we forecast in the budget," Keating said. "I am sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year ... And a fall as proportion of GDP." Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account deficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures showed an encouraging trend. Keating said the government would maintain responsible economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an election, because it would take time to stabilise Australia's 80 billion dlr foreign debt. "We have to build the import competing sector back," he said. "We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and manufacturing." Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and continued with wage restraint and deregulation. The Government would follow with spending cuts in its economic statement on May 14, he said. REUTER 

U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been "acting a bit strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks. Reuter 

Indonesia has protested to the European Community (EC) about its plan to raise import duties on vegetable oils, which will affect the country's palm oil exports to the EC, Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said. "Indonesia, both individually and together with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), has protested against the EC plan to increase duties on vegetable oil imports," he told Indonesian reporters. "We very much regret the community's plan," he added. He did not say in what form the Indonesian protest was made. Indonesia is a major palm oil producer. According to central bank figures, Indonesia exported 362,700 tonnes of crude palm oil to EC countries in calendar 1985 and 301,400 tonnes in the first 10 months of 1986. Complete 1986 figures are not yet available. Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said recently that the increase in EC duties would add a new burden to ASEAN countries at a time when they were trying to strengthen their economies in the face of lower commodity prices.

Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said. No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day talks, they said. Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March. Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said. "The situation is unchanged," consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. "As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in meeting." At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using "objective criteria," which would likely have reduced Brazil's share. Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table. "As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags," he told Reuters. Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said. The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said. There, the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas, Montes said. The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take up the remainder of today's session, delegates said. Reuter 

Anchor Glass Container Corp said first quarter net income is now expected to exceed the 3.1 mln dlrs earned before extraordinary items in the year earlier quarter. Previously, the company had said first quarter results would likely be lower than for the 1986 period due to production disruptions caused by the large number of production line changes scheduled during the first quarter, its statement pointed out. While the disruptive effects of the production line changes had occurred in line with expectations, Anchor Glass said, first quarter operating results were helped by lower than anticipated operating costs and improved margins on sales as a result of a more favorable product mix. The company said its income performance for the full year remains very good. It also said Anchor Hocking Corp <ARH> has converted the entire principal balance of its Anchor Glass convertible subordinated note to 576,694 Anchor Glass common shares. Anchor Glass said the conversion decreased its total debt and increased stockholders' equity by about 9.4 mln dlrs and increased common shares outstanding to 13,902,716. It said the conversion will also reduce its annualized net interest expense by about 1.1 mln dlrs, or 600,000 dlrs after taxes. Reuter 

Coffee futures dipped further and closed below one dlr a pound for the first time in six years. Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. "This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices," she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said. Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar discouraged new buying. "The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know which way to go," one analyst said. Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen pork bellies finished sharply lower. Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition. Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter. Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices. Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses. Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were lower. Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from 61.5 mln planted last year. Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres, but was larger than analysts expected. Reuter 

Baker International Corp treasurer Eric Mattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed merger with Hughes Tool Co <HT> but declined to say if or what compromises might be acceptable to it. The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when Hughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent decree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker. Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker. Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes did not want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree until after Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations were sold. Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was possible between the two giant oilfield service companies. "The company's position is we would like to see the merger be completed, which is in the best interests of our shareholders and their shareholders," Mattson said. "Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the litigation, I can't go any further than that," he said. Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday to force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent decree.

Regie Nationale des Usines Renault <RENA.PA> said it and Chrysler Corp <C> have signed a letter of intent in which Chrysler plans to buy American Motors Corp <AMO.N>, 46 pct owned by Renault. Renault President Raymond Levy said in a statement issued by the French state car group the agreement was an important stage in Renault's redeployment. "It will allow Renault to continue its export programme to the U.S. And also opens a perspective of cooperation with a major American constructor," the statement said. Under the terms of the letter of intent, Chrysler will purchase Renault's stake held in the form of bonds and shares. The Renault statement quoted Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca as saying, "We welcome AMC shareholders into the Chrysler family." He added that the accord would allow Renault and Chrysler to study the development of future products destined to be distributed by Renault and Chrysler in the North American and world markets. "Renault is a leader in our industry and I am happy to be working with them," Iacocca was quoted as saying. Chrysler will pay for Renault's AMC interests held in bonds by a 200 mln dlr bond and will pay up to 350 mln dlrs for Renault share interests, depending on AMC sales and future profits, the Renault statement said. The statement said the agreement in principle gave each side 30 days to put together a definitive accord. Approval would also be necessary from the Renault, Chrysler and AMC boards, from AMC shareholders and the relevant government authorities. If the deal goes ahead, the statement said, AMC shareholders other than Renault will receive Chrysler shares for each of their shares valued at four dlrs. AMC shareholders with convertible preferential shares will have the possibility to exchange them for Chrysler shares on the same conditions as those they would have had in exchanging them for AMC shares.

The Agriculture Department's widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDA official said. All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity Operations Division for the USDA. USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts, depending on what the differential is. USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices. "We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a month, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any nearby time," Burgess said. Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. "If we're off the mark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the mark if we're too low?" he said. While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall, Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being planned right now. "We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and we don't make changes often," he said. Reuter 

The EC Commission said it was adopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of production quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel products which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods. In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that the industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity by 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in 1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year. The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing quotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market. Reuter 

A reduction of the U.S. federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said. Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now. "Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down." He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits. Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well. "We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go," Yeutter said. He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a "level playing field" for trade. The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down. On the fiscal side, Yeutter said "the budget deficit is still our biggest problem" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit. In the international area, he said that "our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth." Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said "Japan is just not doing the job on the import side." Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner. In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued. "The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end," Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, "the dollar will be the equalizer." Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers. He said "there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem." Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said. "There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation," Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems.

Chrysler Corp said its board declared a three-for-two stock split in the form of a 50 pct stock dividend and raised the quarterly dividend by seven pct. The company said the dividend was raised to 37.5 cts a share from 35 cts on a pre-split basis, equal to a 25 ct dividend on a post-split basis. Chrysler said the stock dividend is payable April 13 to holders of record March 23 while the cash dividend is payable April 15 to holders of record March 23. It said cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. With the split, Chrysler said 13.2 mln shares remain to be purchased in its stock repurchase program that began in late 1984. That program now has a target of 56.3 mln shares with the latest stock split.

The proposal, which needs approval by EC ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban. "It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said.

Swissair <SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that, in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38. President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies. "Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines."

General Public Utilities Corp said its board declared a dividend of 15 cts per share on common stock, its first dividend since it omitted payment in February 1980 as a result of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979. The company said it was able to declare the dividend due to progress in the cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two. A company spokesman said GPU expects to continue declaring dividends on a quarterly basis, with the rate depending on the progress of the cleanup and on other company operations. GPU said the dividend is of "modest size," representing less than a third of the amount paid as a dividend by the average electric utility.

Western agricultural attaches in Moscow said they had no evidence to substantiate rumours that last April's Chernobyl nuclear disaster had a worse effect on Soviet grain than first reported. Current Soviet interest in chartering ships to carry grain from the U.S. Helped prompt the rumours on world markets. But the diplomats said they had seen no reports in the state press and heard no comments from officials to substantiate them. The official media was initially slow in reporting the accident but, under Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for openness, gradually gave more and more details. Land around the nuclear plant was contaminated to varying degrees. Some is now being used to grow industrial crops instead of grain. REUTER 

The Bank of England does not favour the introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said. Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual dinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested," he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a company's management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said. Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he said. In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result." They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added. REUTER 

Zimbabwe has confirmed an outbreak of the animal-borne hoof-and-mouth disease, which prompted Botswana on Thursday to stop imports of almost all Zimbabwean meat products.

Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3.6 billion, the parent company said in a statement. The rise, however, partly reflected the inclusion of the first full business year of three acquisitions made in 1985. Excluding these, BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985. Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materials operations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from United Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV <AKZO.AS>. BASF said it expected a U.S. Investment of 240 mln dlrs in 1987, part of a five-year programme totalling one billion. U.S. Projects completed in 1986 included the second acrylic acid plant in Freeport, Texas, a technical centre in Southfield, Michigan, in which paint lines from automotive plants can be refitted, and the new agricultural research centre in Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina.

"Good domestic demand, higher operating earnings and a strng export business, probably benefitting from a lower dollar and effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to aid Du Pont." He also noted that energy earnings in the first quarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude prices. Semegran expects first quarter earnings of about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year. He also expects the company to raise its annual dividend about 20 to 30 cts a share, from its current dividend of 3.20 dlrs a share, "and a stock split is possible but it has a low probablility."

Other countries represented at today's talks were Italy, which refused to attend last month's meeting on the grounds that it was being excluded from the real discussions, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review the slow progress being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr U.S. Trade deficit and persuading West Germany and Japan to open their economies to more foreign imports.

Italy's response to protests by U.S. Soybean producers about the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats had not been encouraging, American Soybean Association (ASA) board chairman George Fluegel said. Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producer delegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, told Reuters in an interview meetings with officials from the Italian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yielded much to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against the proposed tax. Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that the attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared "more realistic." He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S. Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds. Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against the proposed tax, he said, "Realistically, from the information we're getting, it looks like the English, the Germans, hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark."

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the tax. ASA president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague American soybean producers were confident the proposed tax would be rejected. Reuter 

Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis. In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries. He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem. "We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform," Dawkins said. The Venice summit is scheduled for June. He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, the eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system. Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes. "We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice." The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years, he said.

World Bank President Barber Conable called on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, for its own sake as well as that of the world economy. "Japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanese businessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additional support." With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said. Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan's advantage. It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America, China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world, he said. Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted. Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade. "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank loans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conable told Reuters after his speech. Such loans currently account for slightly over 20 pct. REUTER 

Middle South Utilities Inc is taking a conversative approach to formulating a new common stock dividend policy, chairman Edwin Lupberger said. He told securities analysts that when the company's common dividend is resumed, "the initial rate will appear conservative to you by industry standards and in relation MSU's net income and cash flow." "Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a dividend to our common stockholders, he said." The company last paid a common dividend of 44.5 cts a share in July 1985. Lupberger told the analysts that the company's primary objective is "to create financial strength, enough strength so that what happened to us and our stockholders over the past couple of years never happens again." The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant. He said Middle South's net income is expected to post "modest growth" over the next three years. In 1986, the company earned 451.3 mln dlrs or 2.21 dlrs a share on revenues of 3.49 billion dlrs. Lupberger said, "A good portion of the improvement projected for the next three years comes from keeping the lid on operating and maintenance expenses." Reuter 

Holders of the company's 2.19 dlrs cumulative preference shares will receive 20 dlrs a share and those owning its 11.25 dlrs convertible preferred will receive 87.50 dlrs a share. Allegheny International said the agreement calls for the First Boston affiliate to start a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Allegheny's common, cumulative preferred and convertible preferred. The company said First Boston has committed to provide all financing necessary to acquire such securities in the tender offer which is estimated to be about 500 mln dlrs. It said the agreement is also subject to the waiver by March 13 of certain conditions under the company's existing bank credit agreement. Allegheny International's statement did not name or describe the First Boston affiliate involved in the agreement. It did say the offer for the company's stock will be conditioned also on the valid tender of securities representing at least a majority of the voting power for the election of directors of the company and the valid tender of at least two third's of the outstanding cumulative preferred and convertible preferred shares.

Centel Corp said it sees 1987 first quarter results below those of 1986 due to regulatory limits on telephone earnings and 15 cts to 20 cts a share dilution from 1986 acquisitions. In the annual report, Chairman Robert Reuss told shareholders telephone profits will continued to be limited by ceilings imposed by regulators as well as deregulation and structural changes within the industry that have slowed growth in the investment base for setting rates. As such, its first quarter 1987 results will be below last year's first quarter of 1.11 dlrs a share, he said. "Several of the company's telephone units may be faced with a reduction in the rates of return authorized by their regulators," Reuss said. "This could result in some rate reductions and refunds to customers." Reuss said he is encouraged by the prospects for progress in Centel's business communications, cable television and cellular telephone units. Centel is asking shareholders at the annual meeting to approve the tripling to 120 mln in authorized shares. Reuter 

The Bank of France intervened on the market to buy dollars and sell yen to support the U.S. Currency, dealers said. A major French bank said it acted for the central bank in buying between five and 15 mln dlrs against yen. A dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to publicise the intervention, to send a clear signal to the markets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain the exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month's meeting of the Group of Five and Canada in Paris. The dollar was being quoted at 6.0950/70 francs in early afternoon dealings after a fix of 6.09425 francs. The major French bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149.28 against the dollar. The U.S. Currency was subsequently being quoted at 149.25/35. The Bank of Japan was reported in the market overnight to bolster the credibility of the Paris accord following several days of pressure against the dollar. Pressure developed after U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker repeated earlier statements that the Reagan administration had no targets for the dollar, apparently undermining the assumption that the agreement in Paris had fixed broad fluctuation ranges for major currencies. Baker later said his remark had been misinterpreted. REUTER 

Malaysia, the world's top producer, acted as spokesman for producers at the talks, which began on March 9. Malaysian traders said they expected prices to firm by a few cents on the news that a pact is expected to be adopted.

Ohio Edison Co said it has completed the sale and leaseback of 30 pct of its 30 pct interest in Unit One of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, receiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest. The utility said the share of its interest in the 1,205 megawatt generating plant was sold to a group of institutional investors which leased it back to the company for a period of about 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate. Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance the rest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans incurred for the retirement of high-interest long-term debt. Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments, but it said the "payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company will need to cover our investment in Perry, which translates into savings for our customers." The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It plans on filing a rate application with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year.

Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> , the brewing group, has challenged a 5.2 mln stg payment to a U.S. Lawyer who says he organised its controversial takeover of Scotch whisky maker <The Distillers Co Plc>. But attorneys for lawyer Thomas Ward, a member of the Guinness board, told a court yesterday in the Channel Island of Jersey that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services in last year's 2.7 billion stg takeover. Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is investigating the takeover. Guinness says its former chairman Ernest Saunders and Ward "breached their fiduciary duty" in authorising the payment to Ward, via a Jersey-based company, Marketing and Acquisitions Consultants and has gone to the Jersey court to recover it. MAC said in defence documents that Ward was the main negotiator in the battle for Distillers against rival bidder Argyll <AYLL.L> Group Plc. "The bid would not have been successful but for the ... Services of Mr Ward," MAC attorneys said in the documents submitted in court. "The payment was, in all the circumstances, reasonable, proper and fully earned." REUTER 

Brazil's trade surplus doubled in February to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln but was well below the 628 mln dlrs of February last year, official figures show. Director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports which totalled 1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding coffee and oil derivatives, was only slightly below the same month last year. Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February, 1986, because of lower prices, he added. Fendt said although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year, the government's target of an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion dlrs. Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled 22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion. Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth. Fendt said imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil. Imports in the first two months of the year, excluding oil and wheat, totalled 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in the same 1986 period. This rise reflected industry's need for equipment to raise production and is perfectly compatible with the government's program for economic growth, Fendt added. Reuter 

The company said the investor group also bought about 6.3 mln shares from ZIM management. It said James Mitchell, William Richardson and Steven Duin have resigned as officers and directors. ZIM said Chemclear Inc <CMCL> has unilaterally canceled an agreement to merge with ZIM, and ZIM's board is studying the possiblity of a claim against Chemclear. The company said it expects to report a loss for the year of about 3,125,000 dlrs due to lower oil and natural gas prices, unsuccessful well workover programs and excessive overhead and corporate expenses. It said it plans a dramatic reduction in overhead costs that should improve results. The company said Michel Billard has been named chairman and Robert Berckmans has been named president and chief executive, and Berckmans and two others have joined the board.

Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in 1985. The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985. Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company. In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in 1985. REUTER 

Fruehauf Corp, which went private in December through a leveraged buyout, said the predecessor company had a 1986 loss of 60.9 mln dlrs compared to earnings of 70.5 mln dlrs in 1985. Sales of the predecessor company were 2.68 billion dlrs compared to 2.56 billion dlrs in 1985, including the sales by the operations which are divestiture candidates. Fruehauf said in connection with the buyout acquisition, the predecessor company incurred about 97 mln dlrs in expenses charged against 1986 operations. In addition to the direct expenses, Fruehauf said operating results were adversely affected by an unquantifiable amount due to the disruption related to a proxy contest and attempted hostile takeover which started in early 1986.

West Germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said. Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year. REUTER 

The underlying rise, adjusted for factors such as back-pay and timing variations, had been steady at 7.5 pct from October 1985 to October 1986.

Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990. All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries. The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements. They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports. There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a tax could be imposed later, the sources added. Reuter 

From April through December 1986, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January-August, 1987. These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report. Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain more competitive on world markets, it said. The department said last summer, for example, certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise. The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels, it said. The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986's 25.8 billion dlrs. During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force, annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said. The department said the President's budget proposals for 1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs. In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct average of 1980-86, it said. Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years, the department said. Reuter 

The United States and Japan will soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S. Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television. Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on semiconductors, said: "Their government wants to live up to it. Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have a good settlement to spare both sides." "I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't lived up to this commitment," he said. He added: "I do not think there will be a trade war at all." On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17, because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement. The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs. Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down protectionist trade legislation now being drafted. He denied the action had been taken for that reason. REUTER 

Congress should give the U.S. Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said. Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program "dilemma" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate. Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu. Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs. The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut. Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs. He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an "umbrella" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans. Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for some form of income support, Amstutz said "the competitive problem is the most severe." He said USDA is still studying the situation and "no resolution" has yet been found. Reuter 

Walbro Corp said it expects its first-quarter results to reach "all-time highs." It projected sales exceeding 32 mln dlrs, or up 21 pct from the 26,488,000 dlrs reported for the 1986 first quarter. It said the previous high for a single quarter was 27,179,000 dlrs for the 1986 fourth quarter. Walbro estimated income for the quarter will exceed first-quarter 1986 income, which was 1,953,000 dlrs, or 66 cts a share, by at least 40 pct. It said the first quarter of 1986 had been the previous income record for a single quarter. Walbro cited strong demand for its fuel systems products, especially automotive electronic fuel injection components and carburetors for lawn and garden applications. However, it said it is unlikely the company will sustain the same record pace of sales and income throughout 1987, due to an expected reduction in throttle body sales. "It now appears likely that the company's throttle body business with General Motors Corp <GM> will peak in the first six months of 1987, continue at reduced levels to July 1988 and suffer an interruption for the period from July 1988 to July 1989," Walbro added.

OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again," he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens," Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd." Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output. "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Porsche AG <PSHG.F> said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were "satisfactory" despite burdens caused by the dollar's weakness against the mark and stagnating domestic demand. In its semi-annual shareholders' report, Porsche said first half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83 billion in the same period of 1985/86. However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without giving absolute figures. Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380 mln. Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45 billion in the first half of last year, although the export quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct. The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said. Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381. Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122 from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further, the report said. Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued for all models but demand fell in other markets. Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397, while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct. Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln. Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of the dollar and currencies in other important markets. Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11 year at a "high level," Porsche said. REUTER 

A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said. U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February. "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters." "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy," he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can't tighten." David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected. While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes." In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP." Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. "This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tighten to quickly either." The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined to ease," he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten, regardless of the dollar."

U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct in February after a revised 0.1 pct increase in January, the Federal Reserve Board said. The Fed previously said industrial production rose 0.4 pct in January. The Fed said the February gain was dominated by a sharp rise in motor vehicle production, which boosted output of both consumer goods and business equipment. Industrial production stood at 127.3 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up 1.7 pct from a year ago, the Fed said. The Fed also revised the December industrial production figure to a gain of 0.5 pct from 0.3 pct originally reported. Manufacturing output rose 0.5 pct in February after a 0.1 pct increase in January and included gains of 0.8 pct in durables and 0.1 pct in non-durables, the Fed said. Manufacturing was 2.4 pct above the year ago level. Production of auto assemblies rose to an annual rate of 8.3 mln units last month from a January rate of 7.5 mln units. Output of consumer goods rose 0.6 pct after falling 0.3 pct in January and output of consumer durables was up 2.1 pct in February after falling by 2.0 pct in January. Business equipment production rose 1.0 pct in February, reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use and a recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries, the Fed said. Mining output rose 0.1 pct after a 1.6 pct increase in January, but was still six pct lower than a year ago. Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after a 1.2 pct rise in January.

The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said. The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress. Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito. Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country. He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said. Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy. Reuter 

The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future." He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthy development," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist." "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said. "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago." He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter." REUTER 

Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its board of directors decided to take no action on two takeover bids that the company has received. Instead, it appointed a committee of independent directors to study strategic alternatives for the 170-year-old firm. The alternatives include continuation of the company's existing business plans, possible business combinations, sales of stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of the company. Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on the alternatives, Harper and Row added. Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a share for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a share from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ>. After carefully considering the two offers at a meeting on Friday, the Harpers and Row board decided not to act on them. The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to preserve the company's independence and take advantage of its "considerable future prospects," according to director Winthrop Knowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newly established independent committee. "However, given the significant current interest in the company, we also feel that we should carefully review all the options available. The committee will consider all the pertinent facts and alternatives... We intend to make a careful and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to a conclusion," Knowlton said. Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board has postponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that had been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to recapitalize the company's stock in order to create two classes of shares with different votinmg rights.

A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels. Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis. Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab Cambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered. "I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the dollar," Viermetz said. "I believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987." The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February to stabilise major currencies around current levels. The accord came after months of transatlantic argument, with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and Japanese exporters. The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances. But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade deficit would improve only temporarily. He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160 billion dlrs. "This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in Washington," he said. Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck when the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen. Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or "Plaza Accord," the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240 yen. Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to see the dollar hold within a "loose range" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks and 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency lower being countered by central bank intervention. The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen -- its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40 years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks. Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar. But at the same time, worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4 pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world. The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres. Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on the role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards securitisation of business. Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers Association, said Arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking. REUTER 

Japan Line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the end of September, which exceeded shareholders' equities and reserves totalling 63.40 billion. In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries.

The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares.

China's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters. Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct. China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said. Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct. Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion. A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market. The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said. A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country's total debt at about 30 pct. The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares. "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," he said. The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s. "Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People's Republic of China," he said. "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls," he said. The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16. A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs. "The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said. The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development." Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985. A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago. The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago. The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases. "We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," he added. Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs. A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct. "We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account," he said. He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing. REUTER 

The senior Republican on the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana, called for repeal of the cargo preference law that aids the American shipping industry but which he said hurts farmers. "Cargo preference is a costly special interest operated at the expense of American farmers and dockworkers," Lugar said in signing on as a co-sponsor or cargo preference repeal legislation. The law requires shipment of U.S. goods on American ships rather than foreign vessels which are less costly. Reuter 

The American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8 pct from year-ago levels to about 8.3 mln barrels a day. In its monthly report on U.S. oil supplies and stocks, API said that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measured by products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mln barrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986. API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S. production of more than one mln barrels a day. API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level. So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of 1986. It said crude oil production for the first two months of 1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable year-ago period while crude imports were up 30.6 pct. Reuter 

Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to three cents this morning on the rumors, which were expected to boost futures prices on today's open. The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with U.S. agriculture officials. Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in light of a Soviet trade official's statement that the previous purchase had satisfied near-term needs. Reuter 

Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way and will be completed sometime next month. The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far, and they said Japan would comment on the final results. A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries. Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said. OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May. One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy, and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said. "The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country, such as geography," the source said. He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world. "This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm market further, but this would have little impact on Japan's agriculture policy," he said, without giving further details. A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said. Reuter 

An investor group led by New York investor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with Fairchild Industries Inc management and was considering boosting its holdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviation company's outstanding stock. The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding. The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the total outstanding stock. The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild Industries officials to inform them "that they do not believe management has been successful in enhancing or protecting shareholder values." It said it was considering the additional share purchases to enable it to "assert a greater degree of influence over the future management and policies of the issuer." It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in management policies, available financial resources and other factors. The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other measures intended to influence Fairchild management and policies, either alone or in concert with other investors. The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles that is advised by Soros. The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2, it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold 6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19. A Fairchild Industries official later said Soros had told the company he was not dissatisfied with its management. "Contrary to the filing, Mr. Soros has told the company today that he is not dissatisfied with management," Fairchild's Bill Fulwider told Reuters. However, Fulwider said the company would have nothing to say at this time about Soros' disclosure that he may buy up enough additional Fairchild shares to hold as much as 49.9 pct of the company's outstanding stock.

NAWG President Jim Miller said in a statement that the organization wanted to convey to Secretary Schultz the importance that exports hold for U.S. agriculture and the degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable State Department trade policies to remain profitable. "Foreign policy decisions of the U.S. State Department have in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product to overseas markets," he said. Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet next month with representatives of the Soviet Union, and the NAWG "wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union." The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is held in Washington to allow grower-leaders from around the country to meet with their state congressional delegations and members of the executive branch.

A bidding war for Viacom International Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20 days from the day we mail," said the source. The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes, were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs. Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs. Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner, rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4. Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc <CBS>. The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates nine satellite television services and owns television and radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films and other programs for television. Reuter 

Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87) is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow in its monthly sugar market review. Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations. Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said. Reuter 

Southern New England Telecommunications Corp, SNET, said it expects to have good earnings in 1987 against 4.46 dlrs per share or 139.2 mln dlrs in 1986. The company also said it expects capital spending to rise to about 355 mln dlrs in 1987, up from 289 mln dlrs a year ago. However, senior vice president of finance Daniel Miglio told a meeting of analysts that there was some uncertainty in its earnings outlook because SNET is currently involved in negotiations with state regulators on its rate of return on equity which currently stands at 16.2 pct.

A proposal by two U.S. House Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a House subcommittee today. "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," said Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is the first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal." The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat. The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20 pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits. Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five years, protect family farms and eliminate government accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be halted. However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would "involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a family farmer is." Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas. Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and therefore eligible for payments. Reuter 

The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing," the EIU said. "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fsical policy," it said. It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said. On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look "increasingly sick." Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said. On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. Reuter 

The Chinese port of Ningbo is working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from Shanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said. Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China -- handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mln in 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln tonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986. Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its inadequate facilities, including a single track rail line linking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network. Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can handle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour. Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since 1979, official publications show. A container berth and two timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the current 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said. "The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995. By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai," he added. REUTER 

Cuban president Fidel Castro told a Congress of the Union of Young Communists here that the production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule. In a speech Sunday, published in today's official paper GRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously interrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in the central and western parts of the island. The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvesters scheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year were particularly "vulnerable," as muddy fields prevent operations. Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign. However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2 mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest was 8.2 mln tonnes. The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the present shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, the official said. Reuter 

U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects," but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, "to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't avoided violating agreements." In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill. As an indication of his success, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions. But he added, "Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well." The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president." In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition. Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption. For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981. Reuter 

The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits from its operations in the country. Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln dinars -- by the start of 1986. Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars. Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided instead to close its operation, banking sources said. Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash. Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply. They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties. The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to 550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars. REUTER 

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling, dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts said. But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed. In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy, Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels, using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this. The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these. Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson. But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy. Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said, "the remarks have been blown out of proportion. Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue." Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, "there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement." He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate, perhaps by as much as 10 pct. "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate," Brett said. Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said. "Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake," one senior dealer with a U.S. Bank said. Capel's Skeoch said, "it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at." "It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in stone, they can change with time," Skeoch said. Brett said, "we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine." Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar. Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted. "Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or throw in its lot with Europe," Dunn said. "It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark," he said. Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term. "Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some extremely good economic indicators," Capel's Skeoch said. Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March, the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards. REUTER 

Canada's airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said. "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada," said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. "Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market." The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd. They said CP Air's management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners. "Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line," said Bradley. "But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way," he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was "a perennial money-loser," analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain. "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else's," Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter 

There is little chance Soviet exports to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods in future, a Soviet economist said. Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items that western nations want. But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage modest export gains in future. Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987. But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total trade between the two countries would remain between two and three billion dlrs a year. "The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit its trading with the U.S.," he said. REUTER 

Congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers. The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said. USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said. The issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending. Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow. Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp, CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said. USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage. It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs, Reagan administration sources said. The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold. The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates. The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash. Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987, according to USDA. Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate. Eliminating this practice, called "PIK and roll," would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments. The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives. The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said. However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said. The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year. USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel. Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained by Reuters. Reuter 

A new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, was formally adopted by a United Nations Conference today. The new accord is due to replace the current one, which expires in October. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented "a historic moment." The latest round of talks, which began March 9, represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years. Xuto described the negotiations as "by no means easy, and we often faced problems." The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports. The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it. It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year. It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said. During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended, but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term. Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto added. He also praised "the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that prevailed throughout this session." Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers, said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is "a vital consideration for multinational tire companies, whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply." He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact "to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new. Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers, agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well. But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumers had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning. He added that the adoption of the new agreement "attests to the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry." Reuter 

Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a House Agriculture Committee hearing, Yeutter said it is "difficult to comprehend" that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrs in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday. "I have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that (stock market fall), including simple profit-taking," Yeutter said. Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official from its trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on the computer chip dispute. "We will be glad to have him here, but that's not going to affect a decision that's already been made," Yeutter said. The decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs on a range of Japanese products in retaliation for the alleged failure of Tokyo to honor an agreement with the U.S. on semiconductor trade.

January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5 pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output in services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December's level. January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a year ago. The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for goods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in manufacturing and construction. Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood, machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups. Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles and parts, however. In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and communication were more than offset by declines in transportation, storage and the retail trade. Reuter 

But BP said the unit, in which Sweden's <OK Petroleum AB> has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987.

Congressmen from beef producing states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef. Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea. Daub was joined by several other lawmakers. U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied "we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea." She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues. Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S. pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said.

The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year. In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, Congressional sources said. The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988. The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion now. Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate. The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration make an offer, but urges such action. The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work. Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said. Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New Zealand and Ireland. The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S. beef imports. Other miscellaneous amendments included: -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports. -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a Canadian countervailing duty case this year. -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax. -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77 billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's annual report said. It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision occurring in the United States, the report said. Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased 298 billion cubic feet of reserves. Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these gains, the report said. All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14 mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years. Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions "will be an integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available at attractive prices." The company said it expects "the marketing climate for natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our inventory of attractive opportunities." Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985. Reuter 

The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed. The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March. The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings. At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets." The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, "the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions." In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data. One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken. The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge." The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit. Reuter 

French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is 49.6 pct owned by Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise its capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one issue of shares and investment certificates to finance expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts. For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs. The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans. These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes said. Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark. Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes said. If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants, either in the maize or wheat starch sector. Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its capital increase. Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year, has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future. REUTER 

Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference. Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations. Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986, Dieter said. Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986. Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect. Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims." He said the company's drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus point" for Mannesmann. Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks. It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe. Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this year. REUTER 

Whether the European Community's Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain, an EC official said. "It is very far from certain that it will go through," Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, told reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association. Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West Germany has opposed it in the past. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S. soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon. Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put agricultural policy on a special fast track. "The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on both sides of the Atlantic," he said.

The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender. "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.

Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since the Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its current system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in December, the government's Management and Coordination Agency said. Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier. Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people, up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier. Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to the second-worst level set last December. Record male unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986. Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal to the record level marked in April, August, September and December last year. January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar, officials said. Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders, down 170,000.

French state-owned aluminium and special metals group Pechiney said it has signed two protocols of intent to set up joint ventures with the Soviet Union. Pechiney said in a statement one accord was to set up joint ventures manufacturing aluminium packaging for food and cosmetics, while another was to produce machinery to manufacture packaging. Under the latter, Pechiney, which does not manufacture packaging equipment, will form and lead a consortium of yet unspecified European partners, a spokesman said. He said it was early to put figures on possible deals, or outline what form joint ventures would take. The statement said joint working groups for each accord had a three-month deadline to come up with contract proposals.

Callebaut told Reuters that Amylum, a leading starch and isoglucose manufacturer in which Britain's Tate and Lyle Plc <TATL.L> holds a 33.3 pct stake, had made an undisclosed initial takeover offer for CPC's European corn wet milling business by the close of CPC's tender on March 17. The offer was raised on March 24 to a final 675 mln dlrs in cash after CPC told Amylum its initial bid was below Ferruzzi's 630 mln stg offer, Callebaut said. On the same day, CPC announced it had agreed in principle to sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlr deal. Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering of shares in its unit <European Sugar (France)> to fund the CPC takeover, Callebaut said Amylum may still succeed in its bid. "For the time being we just await developments. But I note that whereas our higher offer was in cash, Ferruzzi apparently is still organising finance," Callebaut said. REUTER 

Sales of new single-family homes in the United States fell 6.8 pct in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 716,000 units, the Commerce Department said. The department revised downward December's sales to a 12.1 pct rise to 768,000 units from the previously reported 12.7 pct increase. The January decline in sales was the largest since last October when sales fell 9.3 pct. Before seasonal adjustment, the number of homes actually sold in January was 53,000, up from 49,000 in December but down from 59,000 in January, 1986. The January fall brought home sales to a level 1.6 pct below January, 1986, when they were a seasonally adjusted 728,000 units. The average price was a record 127,100 dlrs, surpassing the previous record 119,100 price set in December. The median price of a home in January reached 100,700 dlrs -- the first time the price has exceeded 100,000 dlrs.

The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said. The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said. Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change. Reuter 

Dart Group <DARTA> is likely seeking to buy Supermarkets General <SGL>, analysts said. "There's been rumors that they've taken a position in the company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau. Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway Stores INc. The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company. The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts. Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment. Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward Viner and Co, said, "They <Dart> has been rumored to be buying some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop." "My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out," said Ballan. Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations, which might make it difficult to thwart a bid. Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis. For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987. "But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to Purity Supreme in New England," Comeau said. He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations. Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts. Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it would probably divest the company's operations. Analyst Comeau said "supermarkets general may seek a combination with another supermarket company." 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it bought its stake of 2.0 mln Ameritrust common shares, for 81.1 mln dlrs as an investment. But the group, acting through Clevebaco L.P., a Cleveland partnership, also said it would seek regulatory approval to increase its stake. Lerner owns Clevebaco Corp, which is the general partner of Clevebaco L.P. The Lerner group said it filed with the Federal Reserve Board on March 13 notice of its intent to buy more than 10 pct of the common stock of AmeriTrust, a Cleveland bank holding company. If the Fed approves, Lerner, whose Equitable Bancorp is also in Cleveland, said he intends to buy more AmeriTrust stock, subject to market conditions and other factors. Since Lerner heads a bank holding company with assets greater than one billion dlrs, he said he is barred by law from serving as a director or officer of AmeriTrust or of having his representatives on its board. Lerner said he has no intention of influencing AmeriTrust management or its policies.

The Bank of France said it set a money market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market against first category paper. Money market sources said the surprise announcement might herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but they added such a cut was relatively unlikely. The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10 after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off speculative pressure against the franc. Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent sessions. Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8 pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct.

Recent slackness on Dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy. While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System (EMS). Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV (Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious. "I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the EMS," Nelissen said at the presentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week. Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100. The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate. The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands. Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short. Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: "By maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain." Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he added. Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central Bank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters, noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency. "It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate," he added. Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries, as the economic performance of the two does not differ much, economists said. Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month. Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates. West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of Statistics figures show. At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a rate of around 5-7/16 pct. Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany. In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month. German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts. But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank. Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22, the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5 pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said. The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted. While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow. "The European Monetary System is not only a relationship between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of a third currency," Central Bank vice-director Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said. "If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the markets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that. We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark," he said. REUTER 

Australian trade unions said they have launched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New South Wales (NSW) to protest against new laws that would reduce injury compensation payments. Union sources said talks with the state government broke down last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later today in an attempt to find a compromise. Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country's most populous state were the first to be affected, and union officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless there is a quick settlement. The state government recently introduced a new workers' compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured workers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary ratification. NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers' compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed cuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year. Union officials said industrial action could spread to other states as the federal government also plans to make sharp cuts in workers' compensation. REUTER 

The Soviet Communist Party has criticised the country's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure proper grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and for unsatisfactory book keeping, Pravda said. The party daily said that losses in the industry owing to waste and theft amounted to 7.3 mln roubles over the last two and a half years. The situation was particularly bad in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, which has been severely criticised since the ousting of its veteran leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev last December. Its new leader, Gennady Kolbin, has said that at times the grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves. Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products Minister Grigory Zolotukhin, 75, was being retired and replaced by Alexander Budyka, a senior food industry official. Pravda added today that the crisis in the industry had been drawn to Zolotukhin's attention and two of his deputies reprimanded. REUTER 

Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders. Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports. As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize. Barreto said, "My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part." He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders. Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them. "There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system," Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible. The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

Caesars World Inc <CAW> said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World. Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization. Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff. Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer. The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday. "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years," Gluck said. He said that after the recapitalization takes effect, proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs. Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding. Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization." He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization. Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June. The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities. As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a "fair price" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders. Caesars World said in a statement that "the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit. But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements.

Kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf, Reagan Administration officials said. The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new "Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags. The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf. "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said. U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

Government officials in Malaysia, a major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week. Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so far a decision has not been announced. The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage. Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses, officials said. But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA. They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members. Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump. Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year, might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this might affect their economic viability, they said. "The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs," an industry source said. The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile. Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock. Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date.

The British Conservative government said it would sell off its remaining 31.7 pct shareholding in British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> during the next financial year which starts on April 1. Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the announcement to Parliament. He said, "The government's policy is to sell its minority holdings in companies as and when circumstances permit. "As part of this policy I am now able to announce that, subject to market conditions, the government will sell its remaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year." The last sale of British government shares in BP was in September 1983. The government currently holds some 578.5 mln ordinary shares in the company. Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers for the sale. Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in being considered for this would be interviewed in early April. In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares in an underwritten offer for sale by tender. The striking price then was 435 pence - 7.5 pct above the minimum tender price, a Treasury spokesman said. He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the government's plans to privatise Rolls-Royce, in either April or May, or the sale of BAA Plc, the British airports authority which is slated for privatisation in either June or July.

Remarks by Japan's Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading, dealers said. After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering, they said. "I think (Nakasone's) desperate," said a U.S. Bank foreign exchange manager. Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. "His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen," said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets and is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen. Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S. And Japan will continue to depress the dollar. The trade issue has now become a political issue since the Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over th3pYgks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, they said.

The Senate budget committee sits down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel taxes and other tax options to cut the budget. In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value. Other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years. The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the House and Senate tax-writing committees. The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind. The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be reconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint. Reuter 

McCrann said that "Wang is a little bit ahead of where they were expected to be in their cost reductions, and as a result, the odds have increased that the loss for the quarter will be less than had been expected." McCrann said he expects Wang to report break even earnings per share or only a small loss per share for the third quarter.

Dravo saidperformance so far this year in its engineering and construction segment has not met earlier expectations. It said the first quarter will be impacted by writedowns resulting fromn revised estimates of costs required to complete projects and by delays in starting work on jobs originally forecasted to contribute to first quarter earnings.

Southern Co said it will take an after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers in Georgia will be asked to pay. The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric rates. Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September 1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added. The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a full-power license. The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is co-owned by <Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was due to several factors, including additional labor costs incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs. In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would "cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected 8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs. Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is 313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes. In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts with the joint owners require the utility to buy back significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase that applies to the buybacks. This bings the total amount that must be charged against earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said. Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged against earnings once that determination is made. The company also said its board has approved a capital budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the Vogtle project. It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years 1986-1988.

Merrill Lynch Canada Inc, wholly owned by Merrill Lynch and Co, is considering acquiring another Canadian securities company as the result of federal and provincial government moves to lift investment dealer ownership restrictions on June 30, according to a published report. "We're talking to a number of people," Merrill Lynch Canada deputy chairman E. Duff Scott told The Toronto Star. "Whether we're going to do something, I don't know," he said. A Merrill Lynch Canada spokesman declined to comment on the newspaper report when queried. Scott did not disclose which investment dealers Merrill Lynch Canada was considering acquiring, but the Toronto Star quoted unidentified industry sources as saying serious discussions have already been held with Burns Fry Ltd. Burns Fry chairman Jack Lawrence told the newspaper the investment dealer has not made a final decision, but was examining "three or four alternatives." Discussions between brokers about possible mergers is to be expected pending industry deregulation, one investment industry source, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. "It's silly not to take a look (at making a merger or acquisition). If you're a businessman, you have to take a look," the industry source said.

Krupp GmbH <KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory 1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to 18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year. Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement. Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year. The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales. Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities. An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order figures. However, "all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details. Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985. Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11 member companies which comprise the core area of the group, rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said. The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year. Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said. The steel market weakened increasingly over the year, mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries. The difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said. But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms. REUTER 

Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S. officials said. The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that Baldrige has "serious concerns" about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics firm. The officials told Reuters that if the sale went through it could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering. In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan stemming from the huge Japanese surplus. The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks, they said. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments and companies. Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other U.S. manufacturers are widely used throughout the world, but none have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese government-run agencies and universities.

(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued improvement would be due to good market demand, better product prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its annual report. Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of 104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar, B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute to equity earnings. Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of 80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs. The company said it views its near-term prospects with improved optimism. It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity and production and more favorable market conditions. It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987 for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2 mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American packaging divisions. Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes between the United States and the European Economic Community on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price increases.

Brazilian marines were today working on the unloading of ships at the local port as a national strike by 40,000 seamen entered its 10th day without signs of an agreement. The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years, started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not return to work unless they received a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners have offered a 100 pct raise, which the seamen rejected. "Television reported that the port was operating at full speed, but that's not true," a striking seaman told Reuters. "The marines are doing their best, but they don't have the manpower nor the experience to control the situation in such a quick period," he said. Port officials said the national halt had already caused losses estimated at 1.5 mln dlrs. Despite the presence of marines, there were no reports of incidents. Reuter 

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading house officials said. The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made the request by telephone. A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling. The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy. The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday. He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall. REUTER 

Eastman Kodak Co said it will reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber operations of its Eastman Chemicals division. A company spokesman said the company will take "some writeoff" in connection with the action in the first quarter and there will probably be a further "carryover" writeoff in the second quarter. The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts. Kodak said the division will discontinue production of polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100 mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity, mostly in Columbia. The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers, and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport, Tenn. Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30. Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman since last year. The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from 500 mln due to lesser demand. It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman. Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport units affected about 10,800. The company spokesman later said the charges will be insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

The price of gold bullion is likely to rise in the second half of the year on increased private investor demand, West German analysts said. Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins. "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock exchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs. Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs. Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said. Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver. Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half of this year. The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and 430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said. Reuter 

"We have left the door open and GE is reassessing the merger and so are we," Westinghouse chairman Douglas Danforth told Reuters at the conclusion of a meeting before analysts. Danforth said he continues to see value in a merger between Westinghouse's radio operation and those of NBC. Discussions with NBC on the merger of the two companies' radio units were suspended in December. Danforth reaffirmed that Westinghouse is interested in acquisitions, saying the company is leaning toward acquisitions in the 300 mln to 500 mln dlr range. He said, however, that larger acquisitions are possible if they are the right fit. Danforth, who earlier today said he expects earnings growth in the double-digit range through 1989, said he is comfortable with analysts' predictions of 4.80 dlrs to 5.30 dlrs a share this year. In 1986 the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share. He said the company has targeted waste energy systems and hazardous waste removal, as some of the emerging growth areas for the company. Reuter 

The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said. "The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention," one dealer for a German bank said, echoing widepread sentiment in the market. But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further. Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further. "The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range," Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said. Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop. "Window-dressing" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency. Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down. "Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared," one dealer said. The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact. But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning. Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act. While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated. The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks. "The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment," one dealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done. Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift. "It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands," a dealer said. Another added, "If the Americans do not get what they want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6." Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter. "It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction," Citibank said. It added, "Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year." And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report, "We are looking for a further, more gradual, fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year." But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments. "There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down," a senior dealer said. REUTER 

The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said. The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5. The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted. The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates. For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said. Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed. The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said. Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange. There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees. Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct. Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said. Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues. These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire.

First Interstate Bancorp said its 1987 pre-tax income could be reduced by about 33.5 mln dlrs if it decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium- to long-term loans to Brazil as nonperforming. But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon to reclassify the debt, despite Brazil's Feb 20 suspension of direct interest payments on medium- and long-term loans. "The corporation believes that it is premature to make a decsion to classify such medium- and long-term debt as nonperforming at this time," First Interstate said. But First Interstate said that if Brazil's suspension of interest payments continues, it may have to reclassify its loans as nonperforming and place them on non-accrual, meaning that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted from net income and interest would no longer be accrued. Besides its medium- and long-term debt, First Interstate said it also has 165 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade lines in Brazil.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt a trade war. "The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as I've ever seen it in six years in Washington," Baldrige said in a weekend television interview. "I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to work together with the administration, but there is a hardening trade attitude," he said. President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation. However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalize trading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill. When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade war, Baldrige said: "Yes, I don't think there's any question about that." Reuter 

European Community (EC) industry ministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures, drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer, and calculated to lead to the loss of about 22,000 jobs. The ministers resolved that the proposed closures, which should bring production capacity more in line with weak demand, "remain considerably below the surplus in capacity." They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult with Eurofer, major steel companies and with governments, to pinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond the annual 15.26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer. The Commission will draw up a new system of steel production quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the full rigors of open competition. Commission sources said any new system would cover only heavy products representing about 45 pct of the market, instead of 65 pct under the present system. Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meet again in Brussels on June 1, the sources said. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers capacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and that this excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990. Reuter 

It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980, stood at 103.9 in both months. EC officials said while the lack of growth may have been due in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of the EC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend. Eurostat said for the last three months for which figures are known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared with the year-earlier period.

Citicorp expects net income in its individual banking sector to top one billion dlrs by 1993, compared with 462 mln dlrs in 1986, said Richard Braddock, head of Citicorp's individual banking division. "We can double our earnings over the next five to seven years," he told a banking analysts meeting, adding that this forecast may be on the conservative side. He said that bank card operations and the New York branch system would continue to turn in hefty profits but also picked out other developing areas, such as U.S. mortgage and international consumer, as major potential earners. Braddock and his sector heads made the following more specific predictions: - Cost of funds and net credit loss levels in the U.S. bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's relatively inflated levels. - Customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986. - The international consumer business will show 22 pct compound annual growth in earnings between 1986 and 1992. - Private banking earnings will hit 100 mln dlrs in 1987 and top 200 mln dlrs in 1992.

The Unilever Plc and NV <UN.A> group saw improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement. Very good progress was made last year, while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc <CBM.N> was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come. Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year. Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987. Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal, though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers added. REUTER 

The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide. On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman. "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program "will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading." The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman. Reuter 

The state-owned Krung Thai Bank Ltd will start taking over state-owned Sayam Bank Ltd and complete the process in a year, Finance Minister Suthee Singhasaneh told a press conference. He said the takeover decision was made this week to stem the current heavy losses of Sayam and to avoid competition between the two state-owned institutions. The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts, while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai's name. Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance Ministry took over and re-named the Asia Trust Bank Ltd. Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986. At the end of 1985 the bank, with 13.8 billion baht of assets, was ranked 12th among Thailand's 16 local commercial banks. Waree said Sayam Bank was trying to recall about six to seven billion baht of loans extended by its previous private management and was taking legal action to collect another four to five billion baht of doubtful debts. Krung Thai is Thailand's third largest bank. REUTER 

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead. "I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think it's a very good idea," Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network's "Moneyline" television program. He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits. Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes. "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take," the Treasury Secretary said. He said the United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency. On the international front, Baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure. Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries. The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said that developing nations' "investment regimes do not support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some debt there." Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said "I think you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year." Reuter 

Turkey is holding a buying tender for 100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said. The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added. Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount. Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq. Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more. Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish 1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three seasons. The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey would export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the same amount.

Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator for USDA's state and county operations, said the following changes are under consideration by USDA. Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week. Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said. Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration. VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time. He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus under the Conservation Reserve Program. Reuter 

West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued. Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: "The ... Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments." Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports. Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy. "No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong under-valuation," he said. Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors. Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published. The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered. He said he had nothing further to add. Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was now no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government to stimulate its economy. He declined to respond specifically to a question on this subject but said, "You must attach particular importance to the consensus which was reached in Paris." The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear during his trip to Washington that West Germany's nominal trade figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows. Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn's exports fell by a nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct. West Germany's imports dropped largely because of foreign currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a record trade surplus last year. However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany's exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct. In this way West Germany had made its contribution to economic stability, Stoltenberg added. Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating. He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for West Germany's economic growth this year. The government has forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product. The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is still expecting growth of three pct but some other research institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct. Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic changes in official forecasts were needed. REUTER 

U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities. Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration, "should be seriously considered" because a refusal to do so could "play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls" placed on production. However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted. The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill, Dole said. Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U.S. relations with that country. Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive prices. The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize. Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains. The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes "are not going anywhere" this year, Dole said, singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year. Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he didn't see any change. Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year. Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican David Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.) Reuter 

A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman of the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said. "The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents a significant step forward in international economic cooperation," he told a news conference. The new INRA is to replace the current one which expires in October. Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new accord last weekend. Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative prices set in the present pact. Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint Malaysian/Singapore currency, he added. The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges -- the "may sell" and "may buy" points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the "must sell" and "must buy" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it. Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord. "The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply," he said. The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto added. At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price. It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals. The extent of the adjustment was also modified. Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention ("may sell") price (currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower intervention price ("may buy") price (171 cents at present) for six months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. Under the new pact, the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment. Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the "lower indicative price" (or floor price) of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last Friday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend. Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact. On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational. The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct. Reuter 

Ariadne group unit <Barwon Farmlands Ltd> confirmed it offered 3.8 billion pesos in cash for the 38 mln shares of Philippine brewing company <San Miguel Corp>. The Australia-based Barwon, 30 pct owned by New Zealander Bruce Judge's Ariadne group, said in a statement released in Hong Kong that a formal offer had been made to the Philippines government, which holds the shares. It said it was confident the offer will be reviewed favourably. Newspapers in Manila and Hong Kong reported at the weekend that an offer had been made. Barwon said it was represented by Australian stockbroker <Jacksons Ltd>, which forwarded a formal offer to Philippine President Corazon Aquino of 100 pesos for each of the 38.1 mln A and B shares of San Miguel. The Philippine government seized the shares, which represent a 31 pct stake in the brewery firm, from the <United Coconut Planters Bank>, alleged by the government to be linked with the country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. The Barwon statement said a deal is expected to be concluded between Barwon and the Philippines government in 14 days. Barwon also said it made recommendations to the government on how it could purchase the class A shares, which can only be held by a Philippine national or a firm which is at least 60 pct held by a member of the country. It did not elaborate. The Hong Kong Economical Journal quoted a spokesman of Jacksons as saying Barwon plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to meet the criteria. <San Miguel Brewery Ltd>, a locally listed firm 69.65 pct held by San Miguel's <Neptunia Corp> affiliate, was last traded at 16.30 H.K.

European Community finance ministers discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic. The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn. It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports. But diplomats said several member states, led by West Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy, especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels. "Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather too pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired the meeting. The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe. But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy. The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France, while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth. 

Industrial holding company Williams Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc. The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last night of 397p. A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash alternative. The offer will include a partial convertible alternative under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69 mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their ordinary share allocations. The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg. Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986 rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln. Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it centred on <Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares. Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also result from normal trading. In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its capitalisation up to around 380 mln. The convertible offer would be on the basis of four Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of 400.2p a share. The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price down to 733p from last night's close at 750p. Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or 0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct. There was no immediate response from Norcros. REUTER 

Grain trade representatives continued to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports. "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks. An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the (wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the basis of the speculation. One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before mid-year, if it was "competitively priced." Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading organization, told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but said that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced. "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are looking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (the administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they should find ways to do it." Reuter 

A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting Co by Dudley Taft and other investors includes a plan to sell the company's Entertainment Group, according to one of the investors. Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital Corp <NARR>, which is participating in the buyout plan, declined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the Entertainment Group. "We are considering selling the group," Nelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood film studios which might be interested. Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per share offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12 pct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families. Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but continues as vice chairman of the company. Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by March 12. If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company financed by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said. Narragansett is an investment management company specializing in leveraged buyout transactions. Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to say investors believe the bidders may raise their price. Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and American Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return telephohe calls seeking comment. But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said "I don't think it's worth 150 dlrs." He noted Taft recently agreed to sell a group of independent television stations at a loss. He said the entertainment group, which includes the Hanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a glut of animated product. Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its major stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the company. MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the company with a distribution of various pieces to the major shareholders among the possibilities. Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin Inc said the Bass group has been increasing its stake in the belief the company would be worth more with a change in its strategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent television stations because the company paid too much. Reuter 

An investment group led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it raised its tender offer to acquire Cyclops Corp to 92.50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs a share. The group, Cyacq Acquisition Corp, also said it extended the offer until April three, from March 20. The group said it added several conditions to its offer, including receipt of all non-public information about Cyclops that was provided to <Dixons Group PLC> in connection with Dixon's competing tender offer for Cyclops. Cyacq's sweetened offer, totaling about 398 mln dlrs, tops Dixon's offer of 92.25 dlrs a share, or about 388 mln dlrs. On Wednesday Dixon said it had bought 54 pct of Cyclops' 4.3 mln shares outstanding, boosting its stake in the company to 56 pct. Earlier today, however, the Securities and Exchange Commisssion ordered Dixons to extended its tender offer until March 24. Cyacq said it hopes Cyclops shareholders "will withdraw previously tendered shares from Dixons' tender offer to take advantage of Cyacq's higher offer." The SEC's order came after Cyacq filed suit to block Dixons from taking control of Cyclops and to force an extension of Dixons' tender offer. A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment on the sweetened bid from Cyacq. Cyacq said its new offer is also subject to Cyclops rescinding any agreements with Dixons under which the U.K.-based firm would receive "break-up fees" or expenses from Cyclops or could buy Cyclops common stock from the Pittsburgh-based company.

Dow Chemical Co believes strong margins for chemical products could result in record earnings this year, Chairman Paul Oreffice said. "I'm hoping we will have the best year in our history profit-wise," he told reporters following a speech at The American Institute of Chemical Engineers meeting. "I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year, or close to it," Oreffice said. In 1986, Dow earned 741 mln dlrs an increase from 1985's 58 mln dlrs brought about by falling oil prices and resulting cheaper feedstock costs.

The rise brought year-on-year inflation to 19.77 pct compared with 23.72 pct at end-february 1986 and 21.66 pct for the year ending january 1987. The government has predicted that inflation this year would be lower than in 1986 when it reached 20.9 pct. Reuter 

U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987. "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein. "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts. "February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt. May Department Stores Co <MAY> and K Mart Corp <KM> were among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month. "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales," said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber. Sears Roebuck and Co <S> posted a 4.9 pct increase. "Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong catalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan. Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales. Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales were strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog demand was consistently strong throughout the period. Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest. Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories than a year ago. "February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

The proposed 757 mln dlr deal under which Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp was described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies. Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC common stock could be fairly valued at "just under five dlrs a share" given changes brought by tax reform and that Chrysler's offer to pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders other than Renault as a "a good price for Chrysler. AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4. Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studying the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he regarded the proposal as a "done deal" because "I can't believe anybody else would make a bid." "It's a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst told Reuters. "Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC) Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier (mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers will have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around to service the products," Glantz said. Analyst Thomas O'Grady said Chrysler would be getting more manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada, for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return after its prolonged loss-making investment in AMC.

Southwestern Bell Corp said that its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging systems, including those of <Metromedia Inc>, will result in some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio. In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some 1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level within an acceptable range. In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from 43.7 pct in 1985. In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26 dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion dlrs. Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of investment tax credits. By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and cash flow. In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct increase in long distance calling volumes. Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which expenditures were held below budget. Reuter 

RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY. <British Columbia Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term. The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation. It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs. B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended. However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said. Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said. If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co <WTC>, B.C. Resources said. The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned <Westar Mining Ltd>. B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said. The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market. It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs. Reuter 

Navistar International Corp chairman Donald Lennox repeated that benefits from recapitalization are likely to boost future earnings for fiscal 1987. Lennox told the annual meeting that future quarterly and full year earnings from ongoing operations should be "significantly above 1986 results." In his remarks, Lennox said management has no plans to recommend reinstatement of the company's common stock dividend in the foreseeable future. He said the outlook for the medium duty truck market continues to point to little or no change. But recent order receipts indicate a "firmer tone in the heavy duty truck segment," which could result in a five to eight pct increase in industry shipments for the full year, he said. After restructuring under the holding company format, the company's present truck and engine subsidiary will be known as Navistar International Transportation Corp. Neil Springer currently president and chief operating officer of Navistar International was named chairman of the new subsidiary. James Cotting, now vice chairman and chief financial officer, was named to succeed Lennox as chairman and chief executive officer of Navistar International Corp. Lennox will retire March 31. Shareholders at the meeting approved a change in the company's structure to a holding company format, to be effective April 1. Reuter 

The Venezuela Guayana Corporation, CVG, which oversees the state steel, iron, aluminum and other industries, will invest 75 billion bolivars in new projects during 1987-89, CVG president Leopoldo Sucre Figarella announced. The investments will go to plant expansion, infrastructure and the extension of hydroelectric facilities in the mineral-rich Guayana region, south of the Orinoco river. Sucre Figarella told a news conference the CVG's 12 companies showed an overall increase of 120 pct in profits, which rose from 1.732 billion bolivars in 1985 to 3.926 billion bolivars last year. Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which earned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidor turned a profit. The gain was made possible in part by the refinancing of 1.619 mln dollars of foreign debt. CVG's three aluminum companies also showed substantial gains. Interalumina, which makes the intermediate material alumina, had an increase in profits from 116 to 217 mln bolivars, Alcasa earned 487 mln bolivars, as compared to 1985's 412 mln and Venalum's profits rose by around half, from 1.042 to 1.504 bln bolivars.

The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender. "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said. "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer," he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

Instinet said the meeting date is subject to adjustment, based on the length of time needed for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to complete its review of the filing of merger proxy materials, which Instinet expects to make before the end of March. Instinet said the filing of the preliminary merger proxy materials is tied to the finalization of audited financial statements of Instinet and Reuters for 1986.

Total food aid needs in 69 of the least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country. However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife. Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop, it said. However, may developing countries in tropical climates, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the department said. World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986/87 for the third straight year. Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department said. Reuter 

The Senate voted to condemn the proposed European common market tax on vegetable and marine fats and oils and said it would result in retaliation. The non-binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate sentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote. "The administration should communicate to the European Community the message that the United States will view the establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European Community's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and immediate countermeasures," the resolution stated. The resolution said the European Community Commission has proposed establishing a consumption tax on vegetable and fish oils and fats in conjunction with the setting of farm prices for the 1987/1988 EC marketing year. The Senate said the tax would amount to almost 90 pct of the current price of soyoil and "have a restrictive effect" on U.S. exports of soybeans and vegetable oils to the EC. It would be "blatantly inconsistent" with obligations of the EC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, the resolution said, and "constitute another egregious attempt" to impose EC agricultural costs on trading partners.

Latest consumer price data indicate U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be above last year's pace, economists said. "Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices, which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a more moderate 1.9 pct last month. The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets. Among the key components of the report, transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges. "There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Economists said the latest CPI supports existing expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987. The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986. Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct. Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become factored into the wider economic picture. "As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct inflation," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Reuter 

The Indian Finance Ministry's announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said. The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct by one percentage point. New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on deposits of two years or more but less than five. Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct interest have been abolished. Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve world competitiveness of Indian goods. There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity shares or short-term bank deposits, they said. A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market. Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange, opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing of 1,012.50 rupees. A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5 pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively. "But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks pay for deposits of similar maturity," a merchant banker said. REUTER 

They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action. In response to a query on what the State Department's position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade. The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price. Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union, grain industry sources said. Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel, while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs. "I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the Soviet Union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group. "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else," Shultz told the farm leaders. "That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets," he said. If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP, it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow, an industry lobbyst said. National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary's comments. "His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP," an official with the wheat group said. The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "there is significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets." In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the officials said. An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets, said that the Shultz comments "are consistent with what he (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist," but said they don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union. Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements. But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow. "If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is potentially a positive development," a commodity source said. Reuter 

Michigan General Corp said it agreed to sell substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its Krestmark subsidiaries to LCB Holdings Inc for 6.5 mln dlrs cash. Sale of Texas-based Krestmark, a maker of doors, door frames and other products, will allow Michigan General to concentrate on retailing through its Diamond Lumber and Savannah Wholesale units. Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt. The deal is subject to execution of a definitive agreement. Krestmark had revenues of about 40 mln dlrs and operating losses of three mln dlrs in 1986, the company said. It has been accounted for as a discontinued operation since last September. Dallas-based LCB is a privately-held maker of structural steel joists and rack and storage handling systems. Michigan General also said its Diamond Lumber homebuilding products retail unit closed nine unprofitable stores in the first quarter and reduced its headquarters staff by 10 pct. The nine closed stores, which had pretax operating losses of 1.7 mln dlrs in 1986, are being sold to provide cash for operations. About 4.5 mln dlrs of inventory from the stores is being transferred to other locations, the company said. Reuter 

Brazil's recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987. The developing world's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said. "That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation," Aldo Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics, said. Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets, but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable. "Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates," Roldan said. The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs. But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels." Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance. Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence. "Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations, which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said. The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer. Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the dealer said. "If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents," he said. New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit. President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas. Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. "They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been," according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop. "Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops," he said. The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields. "We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said. Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year. Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather. Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said. He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan. "We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently. Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation. He said the debt situation was a major consideration. "The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage," he added. Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said it would not make a big difference. On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital. Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will give it little room to stretch exports, they said. Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of surplus. "Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it," one analyst said. "If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would collapse and they can't afford to do that," she added. Reuter 

The International Coffee Organization (ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute. The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement, delegates said. The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September, they said. The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates said. Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter.

Australian beef output is forecast to decline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mln in 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corp (AMLC) said. Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to 480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of its bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts. It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is expected to be slower than previously forecast. Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will continue, the AMLC said. The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and domestic consumption this year, it said. The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production levels until late next year. It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55 pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct. The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the Australian dollar, the AMLC said. It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, the U.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the chilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively around 94 pct of total Australian exports. REUTER 

Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar, which would slow exports to the United States.

Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated to convert into financial terms," one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation." A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons. "Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy." "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges. Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now," said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs." While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said "The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity." Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, "but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners." He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt." Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. "As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations," he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

Any European Community decision to liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more competitive than tapioca in the European market. The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25 mln tonnes a year until 1990. Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct import duty. Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI, suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops. He said: "If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are close to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear completely." He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies. REUTER 

Australia's current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29 billion, market economists polled by Reuters said. Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow. The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January, after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs. As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January. A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit, the economists said. Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments, they said. They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the 0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.

Seven major U.S. farm groups took the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law. Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.) and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the groups issued a statement saying lawmakers should "resist efforts to overhaul the 15-month-old law, which is operating in its first crop marketing year." The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council, National Pork Producers Council and the U.S. Rice Producers Legislative Group. The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm bill "so the law might have its intended impact of making agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the same time maintaining farm income." "We strongly believe American farmers now need predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing decisions," the groups said.

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April. "We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United States...The relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date," he said.

The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday, dealers said. Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning, with operators made wary by today's meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington. It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar. Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on February 22, a "vague statement," casting doubt on operators' assumptions that a secret target level had been set. Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged, "there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar." One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks. "They were obviously regarded as being negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative," he said. Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's undertone. Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said. After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31, interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said. "We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencies," the U.S. Bank dealer said. Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later. The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender, signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy. Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment. Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention, brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480. The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100. REUTER 

The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday. Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms abroad. He added, "even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed," has started opening its markets. In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks, was a problem. "I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt," Volcker said. It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said. Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker "about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility." He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates "is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects." "For example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations," Volcker said. He recommended "we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations" on exchange rates but instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies.

Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in which Placer has an option with <Australian Consolidated Minerals Ltd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enough to warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement. Big Bell, in the Murchison goldfield 540 km north east of Perth, was founded in 1904.

Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes of ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible by open-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a 4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters underground. It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no later than December 31 this year by which time it would have spent three mln dlrs on Big Bell.

Goodrich Co said it will phase out the production of aircraft tires, missile and marine products and molded rubber products in Akron, Ohio, by the end of 1987, laying off about 790 salaried, production, maintenance and support services employees. The company said layoffs will start within the next few weeks. Goodrich said it will continue to make chemicals and adhesives in Akron, employing about 356. Another 5000 salaried employees in Akron work for Goodrich. The company said it has not been able to operate the businesses being discontinued in Akron profitably enough to justify the large investment that it has in them. Goodrich said it will continue to make aircraft tires at Norwood, N.C., and sonar domes at Jacksonville, Fla., and will relocate its molded rubber products business to a site not yet chosen. It said it will stop making insulators for missiles. Goodrich said it is prepared to discuss with officials of the United Rubber Workers Union severance benefits for affected employees and issues related to the continued operation in Akron of the chemical and adhesives businesses and to the phaseout of the Akron aircraft tire, missile and marine and molded rubber products manufacturing. A company spokesman said it does not expect any adverse impact on earnings from the move. Reuter 

The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd (DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp) in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one pct. It said in a report that because of an economic recovery and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is unlikely to face devaluation in the near future. The report was presented at a two-day investment conference organised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks. The report said rising commodity prices and the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy. It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60 and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the year. But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external debt remains worrying and should be controlled. It said Malaysia's external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct. REUTER 

CrossLand Savings FSB said it has acquired Western Savings and Loand Co with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. CrossLand said Salt Lake City based Western has been combined with its two Florida-based thrift subsidiaries. The parent company contributed 50 mln dlrs in cash to the resulting 1.7 billion dlr asset subsidiary which will operate under the name CrossLand Savings FSB with headquarters in Salt Lake City. CrossLand said Western, with assets of 400 mln dlrs, operated 13 branch offices in the states of California, Oregon, Utah and Washington. To facilitate the acquisition, CrossLand said, Western was converted from a mutual to a stock association in a voluntary supervisory conversion. Crossland and the FSLIC executived an assistance agreement indemnifying CrossLand from certain losses that could occur in connection with Western's loan portfolio. The company said James J.

Striking Brazilian seamen, who say they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports, today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said. Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talks would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday. Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct. The union official said the strike had halted a total of 158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, and about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro. Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said. Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to the government, which has already had to suspend interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance. The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports. "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is not conceivable that exports be hit," he said. "But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad, and all this through the fault of the seamen," Rubens Habbema said. A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its normal level of 12 ships a day. He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchor on moored in the harbour. Reuter 

Several leading farm-state Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income. Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks. "Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do something without legislation," Glickman told the hearing. The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan. David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program. The current soybean program "gave us the worst of both worlds," ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time, the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers, Haggard said. "We need some kind of market loan," he added. The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority. Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA, but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a "dilemna" which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any changes, are under consideration. In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment, or a direct payment program. Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year. "Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987," Haggard said. However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT. He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating. The Reagan administration has given "mixed signals" on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said. While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan. The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois. Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs. Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget. Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered. Reuter 

Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn.

Telcom is an international film and television distributor. The assets being acquired consist mostly of distribution rights to films valued at over one mln dlrs, the company said. OSR said as part of the acquisition agreement is is required to sell its 80 pct interest in Standard Knickerbocker Ltd, which makes jeans in Canada. OSR said it expects to net about 150,000 dlrs on the sale of Standard Knickerbocker. The company said both transactions are subject to approval by shareholders at a meeting to be held in April or May, it said. Reuter 

Japan's long-term banks will soon cut their prime rate, now at a record low 5.5 pct, by 0.2 or 0.3 percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields on their five-year debentures, long-term bankers said. The long-term prime rate is customarily set 0.9 percentage point above the coupon on five-year bank debentures issued by the long-term banks every month. The latest bank debentures, at 4.6 pct, have met strong end-investor demand on the prospect of further declines in yen interest rates, dealers said. The current 5.5 pct prime rate has been in effect since February 28. REUTER 

Bayerische Vereinsbank AG <BVMG.F> expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said. He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986. Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln. Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct. Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986. Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks. The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks. The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said. It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business. The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45. Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

Turkey's trade deficit rose to 3.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from 3.39 billion in 1985 following increased imports from Western countries, figures from the State Statistics Institute show. Exports were down 6.3 pct at 7.45 billion dlrs, compared with 7.95 billion in 1985, while imports were down 2.1 pct at 11.10 billion dlrs from 11.34 billion. Total trade with Mid-East Gulf states fell some 40 pct due to lower oil prices, with imports at 1.55 billion dlrs, compared with 2.74 billion, and exports at 1.65 billion after 2.72 billion. Exports to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries rose to 4.29 billion dlrs from 4.11 billion in 1985, while imports were 4.56 billion after 3.55 billion.

General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value." However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors," he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> and Chrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds," he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM," he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important." Reuter 

Treasury Secretary James Baker said the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is only a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic cooperation among leading countries. In a speech to the National Newspaper Association, Baker said "the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement and culminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start." He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in which we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote more balanced international growth." The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to strengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget deficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals. Baker also said he still sees "ominous" signs of pressure for protectionist trade legislation "and this pressure for protectionism is coming from new areas of society." But he also said he believed a coalition was forming that supported free trade. Reuter 

Network said it is taking the charge due to the significant increase in accounts receivable which remain uncollected for more than 90 days after billing.

Iran has test-fired its newly acquired Silkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has set up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, a British naval source in the Gulf said. The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran had fired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit. "These missiles pack a fairly big punch," he told Reuters. "There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping) across the Strait of Hormuz." Tension in the Gulf has risen since U.S. Officials last week broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkworm missiles. The U.S. Has said it will not allow Iran to use the missiles to choke off oil shipments and has offered its warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries. But Tehran denied last Sunday it intended to threaten Gulf shipping and warned the U.S. Any interference in the region would meet a strong response. The British naval source said the Silkworms were in place at at least two sites around the Strait of Hormuz, but would not give the exact location. REUTER 

Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale. It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector and improvements in forestry equipment. Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment was limited with export sales frequently restrained by customers' financing difficulties. Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at the lowest level in the past decade. However, there was demand for industrial casting due to increased hydro-electric power generation, the company said. The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the U.S. and export markets, mainly China and India. The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of engine components. Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a strike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U.S. imports of Canadian lumber, but there were encouraging signs at yearend, the company said.

A Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm. "They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues," Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American Division told Reuters. U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T>, U.S. Officials said yesterday. Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale. U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales. Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner, Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, does not include Fairchild's main defence-related division. In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers. Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said. Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying "the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market." Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said. The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said. U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field. "The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy," Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said. However, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors. "The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley," said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co. U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market. A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact. "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem," he told Reuters. Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters. REUTER 

OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a challenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of Sputnik. "The international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological achievement," he said in an address to Florida educators. He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance. The Commerce Department reported last week that the nation's trade gap, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs. Volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading, writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast-changing economic climate. Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low-income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics. REUTER 

The Reagan administration wants to encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said. "It seems to me that more trade between us is better than less trade," he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations. To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union to lapse, he said. Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited items and speeding up the licensing process, he said. Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment. U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries that restrict emigration and other rights. "What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends," he said. But, he added: "We don't know if they will continue, we don't know how significant they will be." Reuter 

About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from midnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said. It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers' demands. The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four-day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday. The miners statement said police had violently evicted Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a hunger strike yesterday. The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its deficit-ridden corporation since the collapse in the international price of tin. The lay-offs represent about two-thirds of the original workforce. REUTER 

European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said. "There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies," Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and monetary integration. "We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system," Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to "dedramatise" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul. REUTER 

Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct. It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years ago. Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared with the prior year's 5.96 billion. For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose 10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with 1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share. Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs. Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that income generated by the company's specialty store operations accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits. He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650 more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said. Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies, which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of which 1,200 are in the United States. Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth, said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as they are an improvement over last year's record earnings." Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier period. Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam, a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States, although Woolco still operates in Canada. In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time, the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores. Reuter 

China's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by the Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, a top European Community official said. Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the European Communities, told a news conference that China's application would involve long and difficult negotiations. China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in February presented a memorandum backing its application, which De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be presented to China. "After China, other important state-trading countries including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession. China's application could be considered a test case," he said. He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line. Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy without trade discrimination, de Clercq added. De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current Socialist GATT members. On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange shortage would force China to import less this year and next than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment and capital. During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and today signed an agreement to open a European Community Commission office in Peking. REUTER 

Snyder Oil Partners L.P. told the Securities and Exchange Commission it made an exchange offer to Cenergy Corp that would allow Snyder to acquire up to 49.9 pct of the company's common stock. Under the exchange offer, which was proposed yesterday to Cenergy's officers and directors, each share of Cenergy common stock could be exchanged for 8.50 dlrs in market value of Snyder's limited partnership units, Snyder said. Under the proposal, Snyder, which already holds 1,170,400 Cenergy common shares, or 12.0 pct of the total, could boost its Cenergy stake to a total of 49.9 pct, it said. Snyder did not say whether it has received any response to its proposal from Cenergy. If it acquires the 49.9 pct stake, Snyder said in its SEC filing it would use the stock to "obtain a proportionate beneficial interest" in the company's assets and liabilities. It said it has not decided its next move it the exchange proposal does not lead to negotiations with Cenergy. Snyder said it may boost its stake or sell some or all of its current holdings. It repeated a statement made in its initial SEC filing last month that it is considering several alternatives, including seeking control of Cenergy. Reuter 

The recent deterioration in the steel market makes it important for Arbed SA <ARBB.BR> to maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a statement. It reported that its competitive position had weakened considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln tonnes. Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit, slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company said. Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally, should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect. EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota production system while discussions continue on an industry plan for capacity reductions. Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have been built up over the last three years. REUTER 

The yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said. Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told reporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar). The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)." "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S. Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he said. To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said. He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand. "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said. He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports. Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki said. Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said. It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said. Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy, he said. Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986. The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis. In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

About 14,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping companies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at strike headquarters said today. The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27. The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro, said 126 ships were strike-bound. He added that because of resignations by many seamen there were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships. The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct with the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners' association Syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime. While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters say the problems have been manageable. "It hasn't been critical by any means," said a coffee trader in Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign ships. Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports served to aggravate Brazil's balance of payments crisis, which last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.

European Community (EC) member states have generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by the European Commission for cereal price changes and related measures in the coming season, EC diplomats said. They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee on Agriculture representatives of most member states had said the changes, taken together, would have too harsh an impact on farmers' incomes. Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness to accept the commission's overall package, they said. As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most cereals, the commission proposes a limitation of intervention to the February to March period and reduced monthly increments in intervention prices. EC Farm Ministers will have a first discussion of the proposals at a meeting beginning next Monday. Reuter 

NATO ambassadors met in emergency session today to discuss tension between members Greece and Turkey over a disputed area of the Aegean Sea on the Western Alliance's southern flank, Greek diplomatic sources said. They said no information had yet emerged from the meeting, called after statements from both countries that they were prepared to back rival oil exploration teams with warships. General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, said today the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said "The military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions." The row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover.

Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its board of directors decided to take no action on two takeover bids that the company has received. Instead, it appointed a committee of independent directors to study strategic alternatives for the 170-year-old firm. The alternatives include continuation of the company's existing business plans, possible business combinations, sales of stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of the company. Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on the alternatives, Harper and Row added. Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a share for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a share from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ>. After considering the two offers at a meeting on Friday, the Harper and Row board decided not to act on them. The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to preserve the company's independence and take advantage of its "considerable future prospects," according to director Winthrop Knowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newly established independent committee. "However, given the significant current interest in the company, we also feel that we should carefully review all the options available. The committee will consider all the pertinent facts and alternatives.... We intend to make a careful and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to a conclusion," Knowlton said. Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board has postponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that had been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to recapitalize the company's stock to create two classes of shares with different voting rights.

The prospects of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) reaching an agreement on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation, said. "There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to quotas," Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry on coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name the delegations. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set quotas. The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1 but the full council is not due to meet again until September. "I am not optimistic about an agreement soon," Hesse said. Reuter 

The Soviet Union has agreed to cut its coking coal export prices to Japanese steel mills by about five dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting April 1 in exchange for an increase in export volume, industry sources said. The prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for Neryungrinsky coal and at 43.80 dlrs for Kuznetsky coal, fob. Japan will import a total of 4.9 mln tonnes from both areas, up from 4.2 mln a year earlier, they said. The steelmakers had asked Moscow to agree to a cutback to 3.7 mln tonnes in 1987/88, but the Soviet Union urged Japan to increase the amount to 6.5 mln, they said. REUTER 

The International Wheat Council (IWC) lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season. In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln. The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere. The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect. At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off. Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise. After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987, the IWC said. Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC said. It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier. After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

The Zambian currency further depreciated yesterday at the second auction since the introduction of a two-tier foreign exchange system last month. The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at 16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week"s rate of 15 to the dollar. The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction, reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs. At the previous auction, the government offered eight mln dlrs. Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket of five currencies, for certain official transactions. It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auction only for parastatal organisations and the private sector, where the exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with market demand. The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive than the previous one, suspended in January after the central bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders. Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oil company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, is allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange on offer. REUTER 

British Telecommunications Plc <BTY.L> expects to announce satisfactory results for its 1986/87 financial year ending March, chairman Sir George Jefferson said in a third quarter statement. Full year results will be published in June. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion in the previous period. Jefferson said good progress was made in the latest nine months, while most customers were able to maintain their normal level of calls during the recent strike by company engineers. The statement said a positive cash flow of 381 mln stg for the first nine months will diminish in the final quarter due to corporation tax and dividend payments. Earlier, the company reported third quarter pre-tax profit for the period ended December 31 of 506 mln stg compared with 452 mln a year earlier. Nine month pre-tax was 1.51 billion stg against 1.35 billion.

Tonka Corp said it expects results for its fiscal first quarter to end April four, to decline from the record earnings of 3.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share and revenues of 53.2 mln dlrs. The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower financial results to an an expected moderate decline in shipments of its Pound Puppies product line. Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record results of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in net earnings or 1.47 dlrs a share. The company said its level of shipments is good despite a conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry wide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down slightly from a year ago, it said. Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and time large shipments for the second half, it said. Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing last year's, bookings are "very good" for orders on several of its new product introductions for 1987. Reuter 

Nippon Steel Corp <NSTC.T> plans to reduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31 1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said. The company estimated parent company current losses at 15 billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from the sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yen profit a year earlier. Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from 2,685 billion a year ago. Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report parent company results in late May. Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57 mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier. Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April 1 are unavailable yet, he said. REUTER 

The Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to use the exchange. Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry approval, the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at 1700 local time, and will close the account for trading at the new session the following day before the opening call starts at 0930 local time, an Exchange official said. Trading on the Singapore rubber market, a major producer price indicator for Japanese end-users, is usually active after the end of the current final session here. The introduction of the new session will enable participants to trade overnight after taking account of Singapore rubber prices, because brokers and members who are designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume traded overnight to the new final session before the opening session starts next day, the official said. But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which sets a fixed price at each session, the price of contracts traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth session, he added. Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures industry to expand and internationalise. The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry, TOCOM, which also trades rubber futures in Japan, said it has no plans to introduce an extra session. TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day. Four sessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions, but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time. REUTER 

Continuous rebel raids against oil pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombia's present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run oil company Ecopetrol said. "It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza," he told reporters. He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela. Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details. Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage, the overall situation had improved compared with last December when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks. Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels of crude. Reuter 

He also denied that Kuwait was pumping above its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd).

Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 4.4 pct in the year ending June 30, Finance Minister Mohammad Syeduzzaman told reporters. Inflation fell to an estimated 12 pct this fiscal year from 17 pct in 1981/82, he said last night. The World Bank and other independent sources have said inflation would be around 15 pct in 1986/87. Syeduzzaman said remittances from expatriates would rise to 600 mln dlrs this year from 425 mln in 1981/82. Foreign exchange reserves at end-June are projected at 680 mln dlrs compared with 105 mln in 1981/82, he said. Syeduzzaman said the export target has been set at 900 mln dlrs this year against 626 mln in 1981/82. Commitments for foreign loans and grants total more than five billion dlrs in 1986/87, against 3.54 billion five years previously, he said. The government's liberal industrial policy has attracted investment commitments totalling 250 mln dlrs, he said Foodgrain output is estimated at 16.4 mln tonnes this year, up from 16.12 mln in 1985/86 and 14.4 mln in 1981/82. Government officials have said Bangladesh must import nearly two mln tonnes of grain annually up to 1990, when the government expects to attain self-sufficiency in food. REUTER 

Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said. U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase. "Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast. The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said. "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct gain in January U.S. industrial production. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January. "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement," he said. Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January. He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct. Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either. "This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," he said. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it's most likely they'll sit and wait." "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong." In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs. "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct," he said. "The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth." Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work. Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook. Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter. "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving," Benderley said. "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct." A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in January, previously reported at 166,000. Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain. The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since March 1980, the Commerce Department noted. "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report," Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease, but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that." Reuter 

The value of trade between China and Taiwan via Hong Kong fell 13 pct to 7.45 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986 from 8.59 billion dlrs in 1985, Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department said. Taiwan's exports to China through Hong Kong fell to 6.33 billion dlrs last year from 7.69 billion in 1985, while China's exports rose to 1.12 billion dlrs from 904 mln dlrs. Economists in Hong Kong told Reuters that China's controls on scarce foreign currency hurt its imports of Taiwanese consumer goods, such as electric fans and television sets. Herbal medicine and textiles were among China's chief exports to Taiwan. Taiwan does not allow direct trade with China and indirect trade is routed mainly through Hong Kong. REUTER 

(Charan Industries Inc), a distributor of toys and other consumer products, expects 1987 net profit to rise at least 50 pct over last year's 6.1 mln dlrs, president Earl Takefman told reporters before the annual meeting. "We grew basically 100 pct last year, I'm not sure we're going to be able to grow 100 pct again this year but we certainly will grow at least 50 pct over last year," Takefman said. Charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985. Takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986. Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended November 30. Takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in Canada. The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues. Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for <Worlds of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear. Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books. The company is also marketing an extended line of "laser tag" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've hit someone. Other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs. Reuter 

U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption through the year 2000. Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors. Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992. Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley. The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil. Reuter 

"We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more," he said. Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures.

An 11-day-old strike by Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said. They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike. A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source added. By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped, the sources said. Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.

The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years," the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985. The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it added. REUTER 

Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast. But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season. Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said. The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said. Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops.

Treasury Secretary James Baker told the House Appropriations Committee the United States is still pressing newly industrialized south Asian nations that have tied their currencies to the dollar to let those currencies strengthen against the U.S. currency. "We have seen some strengthening of those currencies (but) not as much as we would like," he said. "We have been somewhat disappointed in the results so far, but we intend to continue these discussions," he said. Reuter 

The Treasury proposed allowing temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last fall. The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next week requests written congressional and public comment within 60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported for U.S. processing and exporting to third countries. The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry. "The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in a manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the act," the Treasury brief said. The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including the Soviet Union for processing. Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African ore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export "provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a license for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission." The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing in the United States. "The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made under bond," the brief said. The South African sanctions law, enacted by the United States to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by South Africa's white minority government, prohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at the end of 1986.

A strong performance from all BAT Industries Plc's <BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986 pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement. The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39 billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions. Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper. Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume. The results were largely in line with analysts expectations and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT. BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms. Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth. Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by 38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in the U.K. Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion. Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting results in the second half. Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left the group strongly placed to pursue its further development. Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg, nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg. BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S. For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg. REUTER 

Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States. "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices," he said in an interview. Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices. "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said. Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms." "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?" he said. The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it. Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said. "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered," he said. Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels. Reuter 

CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR has agreed to sell its <Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for 985 mln Australian dlrs. The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint statement. The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement. Delhi Australia Fund owns <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's interests in the next two years, the statement said. "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said. As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.

After an extraordinary expense associated with the December, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering, "we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the 410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986," the company said. Carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of 12,933 dlrs, excluding an extraordinary loss of 17,210 dlrs, compared to earnings of 69,829 dlrs in the prior year. The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be lower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff expansion. A strengthening Canadian dollar against U.S. currency will also adversely affect revenues and earnings, since 85 pct of revenues are generated by sales outside Canada, said Carolian, a leading supplier of utility software for Hewlett-Packard computer systems.

A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it. Reuter 

The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said. Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said. "The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement," said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division. He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency. "This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention," Kidokoro said. Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency. They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York. Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen. "If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don't want," said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31. But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package. "The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in stimulating its economy," said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division. In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax. In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said. Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar. REUTER 

Light, scattered showers covered winter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week ended March 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancy in most central and northern areas, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency said southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetative stage. Above-normal February temperatures over the North China Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the south. Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui, eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversed February's below normal precipitation pattern. The agency said the wet weather in these areas provided ample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need for irrigation. Mostly dry weather in early-rice areas of Guanxi and Guandong resulted in irrigation for continued rice planting, it said. Reuter 

The United States said it was doing what it could to ease tension in the Aegean as Greek and Turkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drilling rights on the sea's continental shelf. State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters, "We have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid any actions which might exacerbate the situation." "In the light of the most recent developments, we are consulting with the parties and with other interested allies on means to reduce tensions," he added. Redman declined to elaborate on what Washington was doing, but he said an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing. He also refused to say which side was to blame for the renewed confrontation, saying Washington was still trying to ascertain all the facts, as Prime minister Andreas Papanderou said Greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor. "The crucial point here is that these are two friends and allies. We don't want to see tension rise and we are doing what we can to see if we can help here," Redman said. Reuter 

Representatives of U.S. sugar grower organizations said they expect some increase the area planted to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987 cane sugar crop also are good. Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association, said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states, California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly in the largest producing state of Minnesota. Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln acres sown last year. USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S. sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report. The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and grains are "just awful," said Carter. In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American sugarbeet growers association. "The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys," Markwart said. In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said. USDA's report today will not include any harvested area estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good. Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start because for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze. Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year, cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said. In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year, but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields, said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association. The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said. The increases in beet plantings have especially caused concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings, particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said. "We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and cane areas in more than five years," said Godfrey, adding that the U.S. may be due for a good weather year. Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

Nacco Industries Inc said it will report a gain in the second quarter of about 11.5 mln dlrs or 1.25 dlrs a share from the sale of stock of a subsidiary. Nacco said its North American Coal Corp unit has received notice that Consolidation Coal Co, a unit of Du Pont Co <DD>, will exercise an option to buy all of the stock of Quarto Mining Co, a subsidiary of North American Coal. For the stock, North American Coal will receive about 15.2 mln dlrs, 5.2 mln of which will be paid at closing April 10 and the rest in installments, the company said. In addition, Quarto will pay a dividend to North American Coal of about 10 mln dlrs from retained earnings before closing. The funds were previously used to finance mining operations. Consolidation Coal got the option from the Capco Group of utilities, which received the option from Nacco in 1981. Nacco reported earnings of 10.8 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrs a share in last year's second quarter. In 1986, Quarto generated 5.9 mln dlrs in net income, equal to 62 cts a share, of Nacco's total 1986 earnings of 3.48 dlrs a share. Quarto produced about 3.6 mln short tons of the 24.3 mln tons produced by North American Coal in 1986, Nacco said. Reuter 

Grain traders and analysts look for a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA's conservation reserve program, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today. The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted, they said. Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week. However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total corn production will be minimal, they added. Reuter 

Rowntree Mackintosh Plc <RWNT.L> announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeks ending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in the previous year. Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. A final dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p last year. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p. The results were broadly in line with market expectations, leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence from yesterday's close, but slightly off pre-announcement opening levels. Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg, up from the previous year's 60.7 mln. The U.K. Remained Rowntree's largest centre for trading profits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985. Profit from its second largest geographical area, North America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar. Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year. Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a 16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this represented additional provisions for the cost of rationalisation plans announced in earlier years. Rowntree expects North American operations will this year, ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast. Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide, including further moves in the speciality retailing business which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said. Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging. The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business, Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said. Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets. REUTER 

Pakistan's decision to suspend tea import licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short term while exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobi broking houses and exporters said. Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo yesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences in order to link tea imports to Pakistani exports. The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports to Pakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, while imports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenya provides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports. The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did not come as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of the trade imbalance for some time. "We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ... (it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short term as Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market," a source at one broking house told Reuters. One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affected Kenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an average fall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasa last Monday. "The trend is likely to continue until other countries replace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea," he added. Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan, Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as major markets for its tea, the sources added. Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan would be worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longer to find new outlets, they said. REUTER 

Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. "The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level," a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. "Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. "There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year," said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said "The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March." Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said. REUTER 

Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said in a televised address that the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced. He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of petrol would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Petrol supplies would also be limited. Information Ministry officials said the price freeze was aimed at protecting poor Ecuadoreans from a wave of specualtion. Violators would be severely punished, according to the price freeze order, signed by five cabinet ministers. The items for which prices were frozen included rice, sugar, cooking oil, potatoes, salt, wheat flour, cigarettes, soft drinks, school supplies and several kinds of vegetables.

The Reagan administration will consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive industries such as semiconductors and computers, the New York Times said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official. "I think there's a strong sentiment here that some industries are not totally up for grabs," the paper quoted the official as saying. "Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and computer companies," said the official, who the newspaper said was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> takeover bid for <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>. The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition in the important computer chip manufacturing industry. Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could have left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for vital technology. The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas. "Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have to be some exceptions for the national interest," Baldrige was quoted as saying. The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency policymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security Council.

Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> earnings for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said. The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year, while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg. The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume. Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading Plc <SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985. Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted. However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986. The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag, analysts said. Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all. Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes added. Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue U.S. Exploration activity. "Exploration is currently pretty flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn," he said. A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel. Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. "If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything," he noted. U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel.

South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S. companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said. He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation. Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr deficit with Japan. Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S. companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred purchases from Japanese sources." Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are "mainly chemicals, machinery and parts." He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S. agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of cotton" from the U.S. He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be," considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense. Reuter 

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled by Reuters said. Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd <HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply. "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks," one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd <WAIA.HK> and <James Capel and Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of <Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in <South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions." Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs. The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER 

The U.S. Agriculture Department said it has extended until April 17 the date by which Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation county offices must determine eligibility of individuals or other entities for payments under 1987 farm programs. Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and Rice Price Support Division, said the decision meant farmers have until April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating how many persons would be involved in their farming operations. Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1 from March 1, Sitter said. ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement that the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at county ASCS offices. Hertz said ASCS county officials "have had to make a large number of eligibility determinations for individuals and other entities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparation for imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap." "These offices already had a very heavy workload due to the large number of applications for both the 1987 farm programs and the Conservation Reserve Program," Hertz said. Reuter 

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar. Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said. The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said. Reuter 

CRA Ltd <CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said. Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost. REUTER 

Kansas Republican Congressman Pat Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export enhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union. Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee, Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and should also include the Soviet Union. Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan administration recently because Secretary of State George Shultz was out of the country. "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S. Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge. Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow. "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied. Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng's statement last week that "the door is not yet closed on an eep to the Soviet Union." Reuter 

The "cross field allowance" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field. "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced. The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time. Reuter 

Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit. For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said. In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes. Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low. Reuter 

Japan has complained to the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South Korea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan breaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said. They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers. South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991. South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45 billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period. The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan. The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan. The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit. REUTER 

Ford Motor Co's stock rose 1-1/4 to 82-1/4 after analyst Maryann Keller of Furman Selz Mager Dietz and Birney raised earnings estimates on the company, traders said. Keller said that she expects the company's 1987 earnings to rise to between 13.50-to-14 dlrs a share as compared to 12.32 dlrs a share earned last year. She said Ford's already good market share is expected to remain favorable and earnings from overseas are expected to improve. In addition, Keller said, the company is selling more of its expensive model cars, which are more profitable. The non-automotive operations, including Ford Motor Credit, are also expected to post improved earnings this year. Keller said she expects the company to split its stock and raise its dividend to at least three dlrs a share this year. She noted that Chrysler Corp's <C> announcement of a merger proposal for American Motors Corp <AMO> should have no short term effect on Ford but could cut into Ford's share of the truck market in the long term.

The world's dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp <XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview. "Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable," McIvor said. Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said. McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding. "Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year," McIvor said. "The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity," he added. McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 "one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered." McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more "super giants", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency. "Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)." McIvor said. McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline. But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa. McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies. "The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies," McIvor said. McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy. Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but "the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production." McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs. "Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply," McIvor said. "Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel," he added. Reuter 

Clearing bank sterling lending to the U.K. Private sector in February is estimated to have risen by an underlying, seasonally-adjusted 1.6 billion stg after a 1.2 billion stg rise in January, the Banking Information Service said. The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an 813 mln stg increase in January. The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of 1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average of about 1.0 billion stg. Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personal lending, which the Banking Information Service said was taken up entirely by lending for home purchases. Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about 182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month. Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg, and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg. The Banking Information Service said February fell within the governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probably the result of industry's need to pay its tax bills. Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1.1 billion stg in February and by a seasonally-adjusted 1.75 billion stg. Deposits from the public sector rose 185 mln stg in February while deposits from overseas residents rose by 43 mln. REUTER 

The Bank of Japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said. The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank said. Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln. The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the bank said. But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD rates. The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln. The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by 0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut in the official discount rate on February 23. New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum, respectively. Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same. REUTER 

Westpac Banking Corp and the Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research said their leading index of Australian economic activity rose for the ninth successive month in December. The index rose to 134.1 (base 1980) from 129.8 in November and 122.8 a year earlier, the Westpac-Institute report said. Annualised, it rose 13 pct in December against seven pct in November and one pct a year earlier, based on the ratio of the latest index to the average over the previous 12 months. The report said the index is now 12 points or 9.8 pct above its trough in March 1986. Westpac's chief economist Bob Graham said the consistent upward trend in the leading index emphasised the need for a tough mini-budget in May. "An untoward increase in consumption spending before the balance of payments improves would have disastrous consequences," he said. The coincident index also rose an annualised three pct in December against zero movement in November and a seven pct rise a year earlier, Westpac and the Institute said. They said this index continued to show the current recession is shallow and is more likely to involve a slowing in real growth than an absolute fall in economic activity. REUTER 

"We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per share and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well," the company said in its 1986 annual report. In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share, on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142 mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985. The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in January. A share buyback program started last year reduced the number of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from 97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split. The food and grocery products company also said it was the subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit, filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and New Jersey. The suits are related to the company's purchase of its shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block of the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7 mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year. The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an artificially inflated price, violating securities laws, breaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate assets. CPC said the defendants, which include the company, its directors, Salomon and Perelman, deny all the allegations of improper conduct and are defending the suits. Reuter 

Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> said new proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a merged telecommunications firm to compete for telecommunications contracts did not remove the group's objections. The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press. Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to compete against Japan's <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which monopolises Japan's overseas telephone business. But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of the two consortia would be impracticable. "They are like oil and water," he said. The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have proposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has been taken up by the British government as a test case on the openness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals said that the eight core companies of the new group should have equal share holdings but added that they could work out the precise percentages amongst themselves. The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be offered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed three pct. Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, the Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially the same. Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at 374p.

Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less than normal since early February, affecting wheat, oil-bearing crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said. The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county in Guangdong are seriously short of water. The People's Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are also suffering from drought. Henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the province since May. REUTER 

Dow Chemical Co's Thermoplastic Resin Department said it is amending a recent price increase for Magnum ABS (A) resins announced March 3 for an effective date of April 1. Dow said that effective April 15 the selling prices for most grades of Magnum ABS resins for the injection molding, custom sheet and automotive markets will rise six cts a pound, instead of the three cts a pound announced previously. Dow also said that the selling prices for performance grades of the resins to the same markets will increase eight cts a pound, rather than five cts as announced before. The company said that Magnum ABS resins for pipe extension will increase three cts a pound, effective April 9, as previously reported. Dow said it altered the increase to reflect changes in the industry over the past month. Reuter 

British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey shows. The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged. The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977. In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop. The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal. This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said. In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively. Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels. In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March. On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February. From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall, against four pct a month earlier. Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive level against many European currencies had improved exports. "But interest rates are still much higher than in our competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at home," he said.

Italian industrial production fell 3.4 pct in January, compared with the same month last year, the national statistics institute Istat said. The rise follows a year-on-year increase in December 1986 of 4.5 pct. Istat's industrial production index, base 1980, not seasonally adjusted, registered 93.3, compared with 96.6 in January 1986. Istat said there were 20 working days in January, the same as December, but one fewer than January last year. Istat said the year-on-year fall reflected poorer performances in the footwear, clothing, textiles, chemicals and metals industries. It said office machinery and data sectors, wood and furniture, precision mechanics, oil and electricity showed improved activity. Calculations based on Istat figures showed industrial production rose 2.4 pct in January, on a month-on-month basis, after falling 12.0 pct in December over November. REUTER 

Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB. "It looks good," Diaz said. But he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale. The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration. "The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers," Diaz said. "Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies." PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year. The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos. PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln "B" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share. The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies. The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year. A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise. The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration. President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15. Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating "fiduciary duty." De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan. REUTER 

Rumors that New York investor Asher Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit pending with Eastman Kodak Co <EK> sent Polaroid's stock higher, traders said. Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2. "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced today," one trader said. Edelman had no comment on the rumors. A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company. "There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said. Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement. The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman said. Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing. Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today from some optimism concerning new products the company is currently working on. "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new product spurred some speculation about their products," he said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an electronic still camera," referring to a camera that records its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said. Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting: "We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go yet." He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS). At present, five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. A common currency system or EMS-style "grid" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. "Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy," he said. Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.

Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the Japanese economy. He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will continue to take adequate measures, including market intervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, in close cooperation with other major industrialized nations. He said the current instability of exchange rates will not last. Six major nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act together to hold currencies stable. Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic and financial developments in and outside Japan. He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February 20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions had already been sufficiently eased. To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take a very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy credit conditions, he said. He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand. Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen, Sumita reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the currency's weakness. The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension, he said. Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending April 1, 1988, provided exchange rates stabilize. REUTER 

Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts, chairman Louis Lo said. He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture, to build two hulls for <Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T>, he said. Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi, which would complete production. "We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said. He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs. But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery. "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification," he said. Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87. CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said. Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship repairing was bright. REUTER 

A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus "corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had," one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages," one official said. "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said. Reuter 

Under a separate agreement, the British government agreed to provide 73.65 mln stg as a grant to develop a zinc and lead mine at Rampura-Agucha and an associated smelting complex at Chaneriya, both in India's northern state of Rajasthan, the statement said. The grant will finance the basic engineering for the smelter complex to be undertaken by Britain's <Davy McKee> of Stockton. It will also help develop the mine complex, it added. REUTER 

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87, Lawson said. Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate. The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular. On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said. Reuter 

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness. A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters. Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said. But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak. U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement. Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure." MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said. But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money," a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said. REUTER 

King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group. His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied: "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability." Non-OPEC countries "must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone," he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output. The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield, he said. REUTER 

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips. "Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying. While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura, who earlier today said Japan was ready to take "appropriate measures" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed the tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. "It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date," Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users, some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors. A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to do likewise.

Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation. A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange. "One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room," the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. "We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms," he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. "If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year," he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members. One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. "There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area," he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. "The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings," he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. "This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year," he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month. Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area. The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts. "Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded," one MidAm trader said. Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August.

China's 1987 cotton output must rise above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall short of increasing demand, the China Daily said. Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985. Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Daily attributed the decline to several factors, including less favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict cotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks. According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to 558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985. To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota levels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencies will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally contracted for, it added. The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south China should be maintained, and growing in the north should be concentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang. It called for comprehensive planning to coordinate production of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and other crops, but gave no more details. REUTER 

Indonesia has imported palm oil this year and is likely to take more, trade sources said. They were commenting on a weekend Jakarta report quoting a Ministry of Trade spokesman as saying Indonesia had not issued licences to import the commodity. He also said there was no sign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia. A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oil to Indonesia in February, additional vessels were loading this month and other vessels had been earmarked for April. Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for Indonesia but would not disclose tonnages. Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had been below expectations and current stocks were low. They said licences were issued at the start of the year to import crude palm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and RBD oil. Last week there were rumours in European markets that Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for deliveries commencing April. An Indonesian Ministry of Trade official said this was incorrect. Some traders here said the total could be more. Others said they could include those issued earlier this year and applications not yet granted. Reuter 

Sweden announced its promised program of unilateral economic sanctions against South Africa and gave firms an October deadline to cut trading links.

From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference. She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and disadvantage South Africa's black-ruled neighbours, the front-line states. Gradin cautioned that legislation upon which the boycott would be based was not impossible to get round.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said it gave final approval to USAir Group's proposed 400 mln dlr acquisition of Pacific Southwest Airlines. The department said the acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public interest. The department had given its tentative approval of the acquisition in January. The department said it decided to make final its tentative decision after reviewing the public response to it. The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North America, which currently is not operating but plans to start service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those markets by other carriers. The agency said Air North America provided no support for its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers monopoly power in some markets. The transportation agency said Air North America also failed to show that there are barriers that would prevent new entrants into those markets or prevent other carriers from increasing their service. The agency noted in its final order that PSA operates exclusively in the West and Mexico while USAir serves the West for the most part with some long-haul flights from the East and Midwest. The two carriers serve five point in common; Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francico, Phoenix and Tucsonm, the agency said. The transportation department also rejected a request by the Teamsters Union, which represents some PSA workers, to require protections for PSA workers. The agency noted that USAir has promised to give protective benefits to PSA workers and that unions representing PSA workers have collective bargaining agreements that provide such protections.

Westinghouse Electric Corp said earnings per share growth will exceed sales growth and will be in the double digit range through 1989. In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenues of 10.7 billion dlrs. Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, Douglas Danforth, Westinghouse's chairman, said the company's sales growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, "given an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth course." He also said the company will make acquisitions, but he did not specify particular targets. Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told the analysts "our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr acquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one. Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will consider it." He said the company would consider an acquisition candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's primiary businesses. Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key areas including defense electronics, financial services, broadcasting, electrical products and services for construction and industrial and utility markets. Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow faster than the markets the corportation serves and "surely faster than GNP." He said earnings per share growth is expected to consistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range. Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance, told the analysts "we will consider buying back stock" but there are no current plans for such a buyback. Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder value. Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs restructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation, assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the company spent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344 mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in 1988. He also said, capital expenditures should be about 400 mln dlrs in 1987. Reuter 

The price of gold bullion and share prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said. "There's been a tug of war between the (currency) speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it looks like the game has gone to the speculators," said John Ing at Maison Placements Canada Inc. The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said. A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted. Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd, noted that "a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars. If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold." A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct. Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs, with a possible spike above 500 dlrs. However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself, causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign the buying pressure is slowing down. "The stocks have run an incredible way," Cohen said. On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd <ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2, Campbell Red Lake Mines <CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold <NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4. The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268 points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC Minerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at 43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18. Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct since December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has increased six pct. "Canadian golds have been the top performing index this year," he noted. In the U.S., there is "too much money chasing too few stocks," Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash, he added. Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through six dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the precious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold and silver prices to narrow.

Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its board of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill" anti-takeover plan. TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its 52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc <PIE>. Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more expensive. USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont. USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no comment on TWA's lawsuit. USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending approval of a takeover. USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together in order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large." USAir called on the transportation department to reject TWA's request. Reuter 

Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks. The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras. The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday. Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also sent marines into the main ports. A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise. Seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about 5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras. Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks. According to official estimates, prices rose by more than 33 pct in the first two months of this year. REUTER 

The main measure of U.K. Broad money, sterling M3, grew a provisional, seasonally adjusted 2-1/4 pct in February after a rise of 1.1 pct in January, the Bank of England said. The narrow measure, M0, fell a provisional adjusted 3/4 to one pct after a 0.6 pct drop in January, the Bank said. Unadjusted annual growth in sterling M3 was 18-3/4 to 19 pct in the 12 months to February against 17.6 pct in January while M0 rose four to 4-1/4 pct after a 5.2 pct rise in January. Seasonally adjusted, sterling bank lending grew 2.9 billion stg after a January rise of 1.75 billion. Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3, bank lending to the private sector expanded 2.6 billion stg after a 1.4 billion rise in January, the Bank said. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) contracted by 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3.7 billion stg in January. Funding - debt sales to the non-bank private sector and external flows to the public sector - rose by 300 mln stg after a 1.5 billion stg rise in January. Of this, central government debt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mln stg after a 1.3 billion expansion in January, the Bank said. Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by 300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1.3 billion stg in January, the Bank said. Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 1-3/4 to two pct in February after a drop of 0.8 pct in January. On the same basis, the figures showed a drop of about 1-1/2 pct in MO in February after a sharp 6-1/2 pct fall in January. The Bank said it would publish full, final figures on March 30. The Bank said non-bank private sector holdings of public sector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February while external flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg. Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg, the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 was therefore about flat, the Bank said. It said seasonally adjusted bank lending, at about 2.9 billion stg in February, compared with an average of about 2.6 billion stg a month over the preceding six months. REUTER 

Fleet Financial Group hopes its proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp <NOR>, ranked as the largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet. Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature. The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate banking outside of New England come down. "If we can consummate the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned," Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other banking institution in the state. He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp. If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said, an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase provisions. The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled up by the money center giants. Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers. Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed merger as "a partnership of two companies." Both will continue to operate existing headquarters after the merger. Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs. That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp <SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion <RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs. Chemical New York Corp's <CHL> acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co <WFC> and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range. "It's a merger of equals," said analyst John Rooney of Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book value was 28.02 dlrs. Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his 60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his retirement then Murray could assume the top post. Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986 on the basis of the merger terms announced today. He noted that Fleet has a "teriffic reputation" after having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an innovator in securitization of mortgages. The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S. Norstar operates in most of New York state but not in New York City. Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would be combined. The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a "lock-up" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding. Reuter 

St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were granted in time, it would start gold production in the second half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of about 40,000 troy ounces. The company said the property is estimated to contain over 500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton. It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150 tons of ore daily. St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property. The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading 0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.

President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States, White House officials said. There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the move could come today or early next week. Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors. The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms, including NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd. They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a week or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the dumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.

Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters." Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.

Prospects for renewal of the five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. The current trade imbalance between the United States and the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview. The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988. Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975. Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was. "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices," Melnikov said. "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said. Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement. "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said. Reuter 

American Petroleum Institute President Charles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. "No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas, floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a national dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a paper institute conference in New York today. DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on removing several government policies that hinder investments in new prospects. DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished immediately and current proposals for increased environmental regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil companies, DiBona said. "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBona said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said. Reuter 

Cocoa futures fell to session lows by midmorning, posting losses from last night of six to two stg a tonne in 1987 deliveries, dealers said. Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book-squaring featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market. Dealers said the market was switch and straddle-bound, in that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be reflected in adjacent deliveries. The undertone, however, remained cautious as operators await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying, dealers said. The market was originally forecast to open with average five stg gains from last night following New York's firmer close yesterday, dealers said. But this was largely counter-balanced by currency factors. Near July traded at its session low of 1,327 stg after one hour versus 1,333 bid last night and an early high of 1,335. Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed and 108 switches. There was no sign of any origin activity. REUTER 

Federal Reserve data released today indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks and that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said. "The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year," said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. "These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. "The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real reason for it to change policy," said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges. All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further. Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year. The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period. In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct. The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves. The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg. Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period. Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct. It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said Wells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6-1/4 pct band. Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today. More Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs. To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar coupon "pass" may be required later. There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31. Reuter 

Maoist guerrillas using dynamite derailed two locomotives and four train wagons, interrupting traffic on Peru's sole railway line linking the capital to the central Andes, where most of the country's mining centres are located, authorities said. Damages was estimated at 800,000 dlrs in the dynamite blast yesterday at Chacapalca, where the explosion wrecked the train laden with minerals and 45 metres of the railway line. Crews hoped to restore traffic to the line later today after clearing the damaged train and repairing the tracks at Chacapalca, 225 km east of the Capital, Lima. An official at Mineroperu comercial (Minpeco), Peru's state minerals marketing firm, said the agency was assessing the situation. There had not been a declaration of force majeure on contracts to ship minerals abroad. Foreign sales of silver, copper, zinc and other minerals earn Peru over half of its export income.

The U.S. Congress is making Japan, with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America's record trade deficit. "Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers to our exports," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said. "If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries," the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill. Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month. Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January. Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods. They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology. In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement. Congress also has been been angered by the administration's lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications goods, and financial services. The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition. Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties. The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports. The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment. The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years. "I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken away from American business," Gephardt said. The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision. 

Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move, banking sources said. The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press representatives were not invited. The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany. "It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates," said one banker who attended the symposium. A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting. But, according to a second source, who also declined to be identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark. "He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly," the second source said. In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance, the sources said. Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying, "No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that." The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates. Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said. For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said. The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation. One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany's economic growth. Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation. This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January. The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs. Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target. Share prices rose in very active trading today, with dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium, brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

A half point cut in base lending rates was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of downward pressure, dealers said. During its routine intervention in the market, the bank trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct. The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17. For some time, fundamentals have led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow wholesale money market rates down. Although political considerations -- the government's wish to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers said. In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut, leaving the market still looking for another half point fall. Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to 10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at 10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between 5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year. Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some 11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated 300 mln stg shortage. REUTER 

Media group John Fairfax Ltd <FFXA.S> said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the impact of changes in the Australian tax system. Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to 25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30 mln from 44.29 mln. Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the company said in a statement. Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings. It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors. Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly. But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue, it said. Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from <Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's "B" shares in Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L>. This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit. Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year.

Saudi riyal interbank deposits were steady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market. Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices. Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation. A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity. Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct after quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday. One, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at 6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively. The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday. REUTER 

The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa). Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half interest in champlin's corpus christi refinery for an undisclosed sum. Under the terms of the provisional agreement, venezuela would supply up to 160,000 barrels a day to the plant through a new company which would be jointly owned by the pdvsa and champlin, a subsidiary of the union pacific corp <unp>. The deal would also allow pdvsa a joint share in champlin's refinery and distribution network. The purhcase is one of a series of overseas joint ventures by which venezuela has managed to assure markets for some 400,000 barrels of its approximately 1.5 mln bpd exports. Hernandez grisanti told reporters after the cabinet meeting that pdvsa will pay 93 mln dlrs for its half ownership in the champlin refinery - 33 mln dlrs in cash and 60 mln dlrs crude oil and products. Through the deal, he said, venezuela will be assured the sale of at least 140,000 bpd of crude and products. Hernandez said pdsva has entered similar joint ventures with veba oel of west germany, nynas petroelum in sweden, and citgo in the united states. Reuter 

Permian said December 1986 future net revenues from proved reserves were 335.6 mln dlrs, down from 814.2 mln dlrs in 1985. Permian said the present value of estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 pct is 165.3 mln dlrs, compared with 374.3 mln dlrs.

Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria. The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments. "Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we're set to see many more eurosterling deals," one dealer said. Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. "We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already," one eurosterling specialist said. "Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money," he added. This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations. Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields. A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest. This is the first entry into the long term international capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence Conran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat. "We have been considering the move for quite some time now and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the market," Lance Moir, corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told Reuters. 

The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added. "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year," he said. The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added. "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development," he said. "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added. REUTER 

Lastly, Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by the autumn, but said major issues, including acid rain, remained unresolved.

The Bank of Spain suspended its daily money market assistance and offered to drain funds with three- and seven-day repurchase agreements at 12-1/2 pct, money market sources said. The sources said the measures were a further attempt to rein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions to scramble for funds before the 10-day accounting period for reserve requirements closes on Monday. The bank, which raised its rate for ordinary overnight assistance to 13-3/4 from 13-1/2 pct on Wednesday, opened its special borrowing facility for overnight funds at 14-1/2 pct. Money market sources said institutions in need of funds were likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further assistance. The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary assistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more likely to open its special borrowing facility again. REUTER 

The failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said. He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected. "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year," Calmon added. Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota, Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln, leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export. "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction," he added. In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags. Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added. The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe it was higher than this. Reuter 

Cook is negotiating with its bank lenders and private sources for a borrowing facility to relieve its current working capital requirements. Cook said it believes the reasons for its losses since OCtober have been identified and are mostly non-recurring.

U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years, Agriculture Department officials said. USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31. Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres, down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres. Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels. Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain analysts said. "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year." Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said. Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres. If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program. Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2 billion bushels. Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels. "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production," an analyst said. A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S. corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not increase significantly, a specialist said. High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical participation in government programs, analysts said. In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said. "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge," he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas. Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's 2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said. U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has steadily declined in the 1980's. U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre. Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119.3 bushels per acre. "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said. Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts said. Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage. "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to provide more incentives," an analyst said. Reuter 

A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP's Cominco Ltd interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8 mln dlrs or 65 cts a share. The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was due mainly to lower world oil prices. The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985.

It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5 mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to restructuring charges.

Pillsbury Corp, reporting lower earnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strong performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group declines. Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operating profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales rose four pct. It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale, which introduced a new menu. Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger King's distribution arm, and said increased investment spending on developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill - hurt results. It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items, rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads and baking products major contributors to improvement in the quarter. A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said. Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early retirement program initiated a year ago. Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 cts a share a year ago.

William Reynolds, told shareholders he would be presenting an alternative to the 100 dlrs a share takeover offer within a week. Reuter 

A panel of four leading economists told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit declines. C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S. demand for imports is expected to fall. "They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls," or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten said. Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169 billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar's 35-40 pct decline since September 1985. The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added. Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline, he said. Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries. John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U.S. trade deficit fall. Reuter 

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American Airlines Inc. "The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest," the DOT said in a statement. AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a unit of AMR Corp. The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan Feb. 20. American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not alter American's third-place ranking, according to data compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine. The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S. market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said. The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers provide either nonstop or single-plane service. At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT said it found no evidence that other carriers could not increase or begin service that competed with a merged American-AirCal. Concerning the 14th, "While entry may not be possible at the Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area, especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in long-haul markets," the DOT said. The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal building limit future opportunities for expansion. The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments opposing the merger but "raised no new facts or arguments." Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings. Reuter 

Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. "The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December," one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.

Shares of Polaroid Corp rose following a reiterated recommendation by Merrill Lynch and Co that focused on strong earnings momentum for the company, traders said. "We have been recommending the stock since it was in the 50s, but we reiterated today because of expectations of strong earnings momentum, its benefits from the lower dollar and anticipation of nice gains in margins," Merrill Lynch analyst Charles Ryan said. He said a negative opinion by another brokerage house hurt the stock Wednesday, and it can be bought at a relatively bargain price today. Ryan said "you always have to look at Polaroid at its weakness. Its a volatile stock that has to be caught on weakness." Polaroid's stock, which gained more than a point early this morning, was trading at 76-1/8, up 5/8. It was down over three points Wednesday morning before closing down 7/8. "Polaroid is working overtime on production of cameras and film, so we expect first quarter earnings to be up about 40 pct," Ryan said, estimating earnings of 70 cts a share in the first quarter compared to 52 cts a share earned a year earlier. He expects the company to earn four dlrs a share in 1987 as compared to 3.34 dlrs a share last year. Reuter 

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips. "Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying. While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact.

Construction workers today began building a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfields to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry officials said. They said it would take about two months and at least 15 mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's Pacific Ocean coast. The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said. The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about 17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said. The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand. The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before. The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific Ocean. Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the pipeline to Balao, government officials said. Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake, energy ministry Javier Espinosa said. Reuter 

The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said. The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs -- PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries. The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for International Development and private voluntary organizations such as U.S. Wheat Associates. The bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria. Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.

He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two week, when terms would set according to market conditions. He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new investments. Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25 francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985. Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against 147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake. Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit before provisions of around 135 mln francs. REUTER 

"I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur, and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital," Brooks said. Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu Ltd if successful in its buyout bid. Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government officials expressed opposition to the transaction. Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout. He also said the transaction could be financed through a debt issue or conventional financing from investors. Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment proposals bought to them, but he added, "the investors must be willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not just selling off assets." Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger. "I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington and Fujitsu, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist," Brooks said. He also said Fujitsu executives remain enthusiastic about a link with Fairchild. Reuter 

The House Ways and Means Committee is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws. The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries. The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge. The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved. In investigations involving a processed agricultural product, trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties. The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture, seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and non-tariff barriers. President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3, 1991. The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989. It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1, 1991. Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years. Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from imports. Reuter 

There was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field report. The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions. However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said. Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said. Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said. The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter. Reuter 

The Ferruzzi Group's holding company Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said. When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs. Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations. It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states. The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals. Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products. It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader. It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel. Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts. REUTER 

Emery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface. Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations. Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share. Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher. "They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer. Emery has shown the courage to go forth," said one arbitrager, who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders. "It makes sense," said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey. But "It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a 100 pct of the synergies." Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's profitability. Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package delivery company after Federal Express Corp <FDX>, which has 47 pct of the market. Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business. "This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight (delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house," said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call. E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer, but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company. Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group <EFH> subsidiary, speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come. The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity. A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator. Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth. Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday. Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr "bridge" loan that would later be replaced with other debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator. Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan. Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in revenues. Reuter 

India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). "The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. "We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said. "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest," he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars. But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added. "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants." Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty. "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy." REUTER 

Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account - declined, he said, without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, "we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly." He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure. The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln. As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a "high two-figure million" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG <AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F> during the latter's majority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. "This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default," he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America, particularly from West German firms. Reuter 

Niagara Mohawk Corp said it is "cautiously optimistic" about results improvements for 1987 and said it is studying measures to cut operating costs. These measures include freezing management salaries, abolishing vacant positions and reducing overtime. A spokesman said the company had no current plans to lay off workers. The company declined to say how much the cost savings would amount to. A five year forecast is expected to be issued in early summer, a spokesperson said. The company said it has redeemed about 273 mln dlrs in high cost debt during 1986 and hopes to redeem more debt this year. For 1986, Niagara Mohawk's earnings per share fell to 2.71 dlrs from 2.88 dlrs in 1985.. The company said earnings reduced primarily as a result of a reduction early in 1986 in earnings return on equity allowed by the N.Y. State Public Service COmmission. Niagara said it is concerned about the continued lowering of authorized return and has reinforced petitions to grant a fair return on equity. Reuter 

The leaf disease corenes pora, which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said. Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters. He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued. Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444, 2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said. Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued. Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added. "The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may drop and prices can rise," he said. He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in Sri Lanka and was monitoring the situation. REUTER 

Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's <RTN> Stearns Catalytic unit, it will proceed with construction and pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County, Idaho, as quickly as possible. The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs. The company said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune life. Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the associated mill by Geodome. Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price. Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201 dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the first three years, in constant dollars. Reuter 

British Petroleum Co Plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing Director David Simon said. "We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game," he told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of Standard's stock. Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not identify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer. "I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation," he said. "Let's wait and see how the offer runs." Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid. The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC> paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times cash flow. The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard's stock price over the past year. BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be financed by new debt. BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit, he explained. The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months, he added. Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly held shares are held by financial institutions. Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time. He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition. "We have informed Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves," he pointed out. Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production. "We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime," Simon said. "We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see prices going much higher," he added. Reuter 

French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told U.S. congressmen France would announce a decision in two to three weeks on which group is to control its second largest communications firm, Compagnie Generale de Construction Telphoniques, French sources said. They said Chirac promised that France's decision would be based on financial, economic and technical criteria, and not on political grounds. U.S. and German companies are the leading contenders to take control of CGCT. The Reagan administration has warned France and Germany that it may retaliate if control of the company is awarded on political grounds. Jacques Delors, President of the European Community's Executive Commission, called last month for control to go to West Germany's Siemens AG in order to strengthen European industry. The other leading contender is a consortium of American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> with Philips NV of the Netherlands.

If the company is unsuccessful in obtaining the approvals needed for the sale and liquidation, it said, the company may be required to initiate reorganization proceedings under federal bankruptcy law to facilitie the distribution of its assets. Mathematical Applications said it tentatively agreed to sell its direct marketing business to Pagex Inc for 400,000 dlrs plus an amount equal to the working capital of the business at closing as well as a 1.7 mln dlr note payable in installments over six years. Mathematical Applications said the business' working capital is estimated to be about 600,000 dlrs. Pagex has been formed by Paul A. Goldner the owner of Pagex Systems Inc, which is also engaged in the direct marketing computer service business. Mathematical Applications said the tentative agreement calls for Pagex to buy substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to the direct marketing business and continue to use the Mathematical Applications name.

The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry today and approval is expected later this month, the officials said. Under the plan, the four companies will set floor prices for exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar, reduced world demand caused by lower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in price-cutting competition, the officials said. In calendar 1986, seamless pipe exports fell to 2.34 mln tonnes from 2.99 mln in 1985 and 3.12 mln in 1981.

India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). "The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87. Reuter 

Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> firmed in morning trading on market speculation that its participation in a joint telecommunications venture in Japan would not be curtailed, dealers said. The company's shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMT compared with 364p last night. The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in Japan. Cable has said it is resisting attempts by the Federation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms, a move which would have cut Cable's stake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit. However, the dealers were uncertain exactly how the dispute over the shareholdings had been resolved. British prime minister MargaretThatcher said in parliament last week that she regarded Cable and Wireless's participation in the Japanese venture as a test case of how open the Japanese telecommunications market really was. A spokesman for Cable said he was unaware if the speculation had any foundation. Cable itself had issued no statement today on the issue. REUTER 

A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities. Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year. And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional market. The market is still small. Taken together, the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs. But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future. Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG said: "The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk." Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA. The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York. The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank. The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets. The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation. "Many people are worried about inflation again," said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs. "Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold." The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited. Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland. "People here understand gold, and they understand warrants," he said. Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage. But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks. The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market. Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct. Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off, which he claimed was lower than the other issues. But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science. And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct. Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm welcome from investors. Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand, even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece. "The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because the premiums are too high," he said. REUTER 

"Cyacq's main equity investor appears ready to pull out and deal directly with us for merely part of the company" said Dixons. "It raises questions as to the strength of their consortium and the purpose of their offer." Dixons also said a U.S. Federal Court had refused a request by counsel for Cyacq, Audio/Video Affiliates Inc <AVA> and a shareholder plaintiff to prevent Dixons from completing its tender offer for Cyclops. It also said the court refused to require Cyclops to provide Cyacq with confidential information previously provided to Dixons. On Friday Cyacq Corp, an investor group led by Audio/Video Affiliates and Citicorp, raised their offer for Cyclops to 92.50 dlrs per share from 80 dlrs per share, if certain conditions were satisfied. Last week Dixons said it won out over rival bidders for Cyclops after getting 54 pct of Cyclop's oustanding with a 90.25 dlr or 384 mln dlr tender offer that expired March 18. On Friday, Dixons agreed to reopen its tender offer until March 25, Wednesday. Dixons today called Cyacq's higher 92.50 dlr a share offer for Cyclops "highly conditional." Reuter 

Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares. AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of 3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23. <Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share on-market offer that has since lapsed. AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid. AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.

Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the non-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavy enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said. Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of the total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program. USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown: -- wheat 2,615,140 acres -- corn 1,894,764 acres -- barley 705,888 acres -- sorghum 585,552 acres -- cotton 417,893 acres -- rice 2,035 acres -- peanuts 611 acres -- tobacco 285 acres -- total program crops 6,512,700 acres -- total nonprogram 4,059,702 acres -- total enrollment 10,572,402 acres USDA analysts are currently working on a complete state breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready for publication later this week, they said.

Sumner Redstone, president of National Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International Inc in 60 to 90 days. Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid. "We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview. Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom. Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years. Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom, four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel," Redstone said. He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month. Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will be a company expense," Redstone said. He said BankAmerica <BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs. After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands. Reuter 

Jamaica agreed in principle with its bank advisory committee on a rescheduling of 181 mln dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt falling due between 1987 and 1989, the Jamaican Information Service said. Repayments on the debt will be stretched out over 12 years with 8-1/2 years' grace at 1-1/4 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, Libor. The margin on previously restructured debt also will be cut to 1-1/4 point from 2-1/2. The package should save Jamaica about 3.3 mln dlrs a year. Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who led the Jamaican delegation, called the terms very favourable to his country. The agreement in principle with the bank advisory committee led by the Bank of Nova Scotia <BNO.TO> comes five days after Jamaica successfully concluded a 125.5 mln dlr rescheduling accord with the Paris Club of creditor nations. That pact in turn followed the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s approval on March 5 of a 85 mln special drawing rights standby arrangement and a 40.9 mln sdr drawing under the compensatory financing facility. Of Jamaica's foreign debt of 3.3 billion dlrs only 12 pct is owed to commercial banks, and Seaga yesterday reaffirmed the government's policy of not seeking new bank loans. REUTER...^M 

National Semiconductor Corp said improved results at its Semiconductor Group helped reduce losses in the third quarter and nine months. In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest sales increase and major improvement in operating performance compared to the year-ago quarter, the company said. But results softened from the prior quarter because of low bookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holiday shutdowns, it said. The semiconductor maker cut net losses to 25.6 mln dlrs or 31 cts a share from 39.4 mln dlrs or 47 cts in the quarter. Losses in the nine months were reduced to 32.7 mln dlrs or 44 cts from 84.4 mln dlrs or one dlr. Sales grew 23.5 pct in the quarter to 398.1 mln dlrs and 25.5 pct in the nine months to 1.36 billion dlrs. Bookings recovered in the latter part of the third quarter, the company said. Despite the improvement in order rates and operating results year-to-year, pricing continues to be "aggressive for many products," it said. Nevertheless, it expects the semiconductor business will continue to improve this year. The Information Systems Group will continue strong sales growth based on recent order trends and new product introductions, it said. Reuter 

Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said. "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications," the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. "Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia," it said. The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system. Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said. It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping. Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing, it said. The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat. The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment. "It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored," it said. For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW) might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly, southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong, in Victoria. Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said. The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential, although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained. An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said. Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22. The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires. Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said. The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks. However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity. The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred. Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from 49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion. For all of March, banks would be required to hold net daily average reserves of 50.7 billion marks, dealers said. REUTER 

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates. The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week, he said. He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen. Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the U.S. Over semiconductors. The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring, he said. REUTER 

U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mln stg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, a spokesman for Lloyds of London said. It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged, said David Larner of Lloyds. The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend Thoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L>. The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said. Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies. Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death. Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved. Larner said estimates of compensation claims "were pure guess work" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged, the claims would total at least 30 mln stg. Shares of insurances on the London stock exchange fell across the board in a generally weak market. General Accident fell 21p to 936, Royal Insurance dropped 18p to 966 and Prudential fell 9p to 888. P and O shares stood at a late 616, 27p lower on the day. REUTER 

Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to discuss further economic integration, officials said. They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket. Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements "is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together."

Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here. However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated. "The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said. Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said. "They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time," he said. "On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment." Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. "Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane," he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year. "The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88," Keating said. "As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88," he said. REUTER 

Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. Reuter 

Switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said. The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years. But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances," the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said. As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said. Particularly for the banks, "recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position," it said. REUTER 

Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day. The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day. Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints. Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce. He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security. Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy. He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day. The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat. Reuter 

Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way." Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.

Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half," Martell said. Reuter 

Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any "meaningful settlement offer" from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco. In its newly-released annual report to shareholders, Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be upheld if appealed again. "To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter," Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report. Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year. Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985. The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said. U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per day in 1985. The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs. Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico's Mobile Bay area. "Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California," the company said. "Pennzoil's share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989." In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled 2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton from 141.05 dlrs in 1985. "The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains bright," the company said. "We expect sulphur's pricing structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in the third and fourth quarters." Reuter 

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise. He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese money supply remains high. The bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said. Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down much further, Sumita said. "I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the moment," Sumita said. Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year. The governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when they meet next in April.

General Acquisition Co said it was disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and questioned how the company might give better value to shareholders. Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per share tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc. The company said it was studying financially superior alternatives. The partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discuss the offer with Gencorp. The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make takeovers more expensive. Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock was extended to April six from April three. It said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditioned on no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp prior to April six. General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.

Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.

Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme. If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments.

The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets. Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England. The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan. The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments. Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain. Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs. The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure. The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost. Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset. The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity. They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts. Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities. They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets. However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations." The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs. Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges. Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Reuter 

Ashland Oil Inc said it expects to report a loss from operations in the second quarter. The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrs net gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay down debt. "However, it is difficult to determine now whether this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating loss," the company said in a statement. A company spokesman would not elaborate. The company's Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a loss in January and February since it was unable to raise product prices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, Ashland said. Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica, a retail marketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, the company's Valvoline, Ashland Chemical and coal businesses are expected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31. In the year-ago quarter, Ashland had income from operations of 93.8 mln dlrs before corporate and interest expenses, taxes, equity income and other items.

Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its Fairchild Semiconductor operations. The company said the rising political controversy in the U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable time. The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security grounds. The company said termination of the agreement opened other possibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of the semiconductor maker by Fairchild management. In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoing business within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concern said. Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of the Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year. Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about 200 mln dlrs. The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations about the transaction since it was announced. Government officials have expressed concern that the sale could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting key advanced technology into Japanese hands. New, high-technology semiconductors are used in supercomputers, which are faster and more powerful than existing computers. Schlumberger is an oilfield services company controlled by French interests and headquartered in New York. Fujitsu Ltd is a computer and telecommunications company based in Japan. Reuter 

A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines. Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle. Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs. Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans. But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans. The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness. They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, "the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked." The researchers said the results show that "food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans, and that these infections are associated with (antibiotic) use on farms."

Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said. The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans, analysts said. The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact. In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products. But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a "clear indication" that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter. MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports. Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan. "The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business," said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo. But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions -- is more difficult. "The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer products. They're well supplied here," said Richard May, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo. The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's, but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end production skills, the analysts said. "The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas," said Edwards. A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T>, said the firm's reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said. Company officials unveiled the following plans - - NEC Corp <NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter. In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before. - Hitachi Ltd's <HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target. Imports are currently very low. - Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports, a company official said. Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern Japan. - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased imports but an official said "boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand." - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels. - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five billion yen, a company official said. REUTER 

The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln. Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136). Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400 (3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195 (196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460 (440), Romania 295 (280). On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88. Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87. Reuter 

Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said. Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types of business. The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted. Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders. The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later. Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar. REUTER 

Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake. Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said. Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that would take an estimated five months. Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired. Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output was around 260,000 bpd. Reuter 

American Motors Corp said its auditors qualified the company's 1986 financial report. The report was qualified due to uncertainties surrounding the previously announced arbitration award against American Motors' former subsidiary, AM General Corp. The award is being contested. The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's <C> proposal to take over American Motors. American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award, made to Emerson Electric Co <EMR> in February, amounted to 60 mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged the award. The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp <QLTV> in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billion dlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM General last year sought protection under Chapter 11. The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson Electric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the development of certain components in the contract. The components were for the military's "High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle" (HMMWV), American Motors said. In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed to indemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the Emerson Electric claims. AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court, and faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because of the LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of a confirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain. Reuter 

Diversified investment company, <Ariadne Australia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares in the Philippine brewing firm <San Miguel>, a Manila newspaper reported. The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the government. The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report. The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos. The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares. Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners. The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week. "Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines' yearly budget," Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday. "Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company's assets can be fully utilised." San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines. Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through <Barwon Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity. Ariadne, with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnover of about two billion, has interests also in mining, real estate and agricultural products. REUTER 

The U.S. should reassess its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission report, mandate more than ever before the need for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East," Ebinger said. He remarks were made in an address to the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting. "Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the current environment it will be increasingly difficult for moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S. interests," Ebinger said. Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be weaker if demand falls in the spring. But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said crude oil prices will hold near current levels this spring. There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June. He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement to restrict production. OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers has declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said. OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months. Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd. Reuter 

Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard and Poor's Corp should not be over-dramatised. Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983. "This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating," Simonsen said in a statement. "The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability," he added. "Standard & Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect. "If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past," Simonsen said. Standard and Poor's said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt. The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns, according to government statistics. Government economists forecast that the external current account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year. Denmark's net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said. REUTER 

Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said. Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts. The letter said the government had to step in "to avert serious economic hardship" and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas. The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk. In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completely devastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally expected. There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks. "Should the present drought continue, however, production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added. Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985. The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed. It said the government's current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected. "Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side." The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family, as well as handling, transport and distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation" in the economy, the letter said. The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replaced subsequently." The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May. The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August, and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986. Reuter 

Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for control and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a national safe drug use program. The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee. The PRV committee received results of a three year, five state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC. "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to deal with their own problems according to a timetable that suits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV oversight committee said. In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug use program. The program would establish better relationships between producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality assurance program in pork production, according to the plan. "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in effect," Wehler said.

Taiwan's industrial production index, fell, largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar, by 8.18 pct to 140.06 (base 1981) in February from a revised 152.53 in January, the Economy Ministry said. It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after dropping nine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February 1986 following a very extended rise last year. The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82. A ministry official attributed the decline to falling production of non-metal products, textiles and transportation equipment, and less mining and house construction. The official said the decline was also caused by falling exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar, which has made Taiwanese products more expensive. He expected the decline to continue in the next few months because of further appreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency. The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It closed at 34.40 to the U.S. Dollar today, and is expected to rise to about 32 to the dollar by the end of this year, foreign bankers and economists said. REUTER 

Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather forecasting service, said. Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government officials and meteorologists said. Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months. Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added. Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for over 20 years, the paper said. The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers, it added. This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said. Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February. The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984. Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia, concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local Meteorological Bureau officials said. For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added. Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino, they said. Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said. Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event' was unique. The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982/83, it said. El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears around Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds, meteorologists said. The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said. When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said. One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns. The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather said. China, where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the May-September rains, it said. The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall. In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end. In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually occur between April and June, although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual. REUTER 

China's top leader Deng Xiaoping said China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said. Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record 16.15 mln in 1982. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy. It did not give the context of his remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from 391 mln in 1986. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where "pigs are not fed, there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed." "We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000," he said. "We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain." The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details. REUTER 

The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future." He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthy development," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist." "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said. "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago." He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter." REUTER 

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris. Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals. Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely. But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals. In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels. Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained. The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said. He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen. The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord, he added. REUTER 

The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said. However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future. "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again," an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally." Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months. "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process," the aide to Lyng said. "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight," said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said. In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm, basic, factual economics." Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expects the dollar to rebound soon, a Ministry spokesman said. He quoted Miyazawa as telling Japanese reporters that major industrial nations are aggressively intervening in currency markets worldwide to prevent a dollar free-fall. The minister believes that market forces will push the dollar back up from its record low of 144.70 yen today, according to the spokesman. Miyazawa told the Japanese reporters the U.S. Unit fell because Japanese investors sold dollars to hedge currency risks before the close of the 1986/87 fiscal year on March 31. REUTER 

The ruling GATT Council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors. David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15. The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips, officially known as semiconductors. The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries. The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market. Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate. Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks. Reuter 

West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar by both official and private institutions in the U.S., Saying calm was needed on the foreign exchanges. Speaking at the opening of the 40th Hanover Industry Fair, Bangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities had left their mark on exports and investments. He added that without these external difficulties, West Germany's economy would have grown by 3.5 pct last year instead of the 2.5 pct reported. Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate in West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was not in a downtrend. The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he said mainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for smaller and medium sized firms. Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel industry, which he said had to be fought with all legal means when they did not correspond to European Community guidelines on grants. He added that in light of the declining demand for steel capacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government would not successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in this industry. Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called for more competition, citing as an example the Federal Post Office. The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany, especially as far as deciding who is able to provide telecommunications equipment. REUTER 

Grain handling at Rotterdam port's main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for the third day running. Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action because of a strike by technical staff. The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain handlers stopped work. Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam would face delays, but this was not happening yet. Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday. Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working week, at the bottom of the agenda. Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range of issues were far in excess of the management's final offer. REUTER 

Pending government approval of the scheme, the field could come on stream in 1992, making it Norway's northermost field development and the first such project on the Haltenbanken tract off central Norway. Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, a Shell spokesman said. Shell has not released projected output levels for the field, where water depth is 240-270 meters. The spokesman said the field's partners have agreed to develop Draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concrete gravity-base platform.

Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct, up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said. The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast made by the Treasury last October. Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct, after declining 7.3 pct in 1986. It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports. Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added. Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports. It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turn around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in 1986 and five pct in 1985. "In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending is likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain under strict control... The resource gap in the government's finances on current account will be bridged over the near term," Bank Governor Jaafar Hussein said in the report. The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19 billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or 2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year. The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5 pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986. REUTER 

Columbia Gas System Inc said a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25 dlrs a share. The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 below Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs per share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986. It said management expects to recommend to the board that the dividend rate be maintained in 1987. Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax liabilities under the new federal tax laws. The company recorded these liabilities based on older, higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained. "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987 earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned," Columbia Gas said. Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas Transmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary. It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary failed to sufficiently support cost recovery. The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from making a new filing to provide sufficient support. Reuter 

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the six nations have taken measures, including market intervention, to support the dollar above that level. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates.

Negotiations on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance, delegates said. Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week. The talks are due to last until March 20. Xuto said, "There is nothing concrete yet, but the atmosphere is good." The discussions are expected to continue late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings. Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure. Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price. It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called the "lower indicative price," under certain circumstances. This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may sell") and "must buy" or "must sell" levels, without changing the "lower indicative price" -- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current pact. Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA, to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi, Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary. The sale will also include the related marketing and distribution system for the refinery's products. A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be issued later today giving details of the transaction. There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New York. The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000 barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the transaction. The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector. Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked for in any acquisition. One PDVSA official said the company was looking for independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution network and a strong regional presence. The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's <SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary. In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock. The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured source of supply, trade sources said. In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other feedstocks. Reuter 

The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. "All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered," said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. "The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well," said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. "We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively," the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called "exit bonds" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administration plan but "something some people have suggested." Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will." He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand," the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. "It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before," the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. "Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money," he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'. Reuter 

The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department official said. "They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no reason now to think they won't this year," he told Reuters. "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers from all sources at this point," the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes. This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for the first time in 15 years. A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's recent interest. Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan, and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the official said. "The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists" and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "As soon as they need corn, they'll buy it," he added. USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes. The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U.S. market again. "There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now," the official said. However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said. Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S. is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation. Reuter 

The Soviet economy recovered slightly last month after a poor performance in January, but major industries, including oil and machinery, are still short of production targets, official figures show. Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output was only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the same period of last year. However, the figure for January alone showed a fall in output of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targetted to increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987. The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met their supply obligations in January and February. Production of oil, the country's main export to Western nations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from 97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct. Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse the stagnation in production which began in November 1983. Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline in Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6 billion in 1985. Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets were also not fulfilled, but did not give figures. Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally bad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality controls imposed on enterprises. Production in the machine-building sector, a priority in Moscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly in February but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months of the year compared with the same period of 1986. The figures showed that five republics produced less than in the first two months of 1986. REUTER 

Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency is headed for a further retreat. Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies. Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said. "The market can be bigger than the central banks. And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore," said a dealer at one major U.S. bank. As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the U.S. currency. Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still failed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen. Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen. The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks. The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels. But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market. For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather watered-down American commitment to the currency accord. The Bank of England's action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing the market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact. "No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else," said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp. "I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted," said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "It's a yen problem more than anything else." Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen. "The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here," said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp. Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit. The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan. Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat. "The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The currency market is becoming very political," said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd. Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May. Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future, dealers said. "Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it won't be enough to help the trade situation much," said Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days.

Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He said in a parliamentary debate, "I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds." Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that "during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for." He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct. Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986, government sources said.

A House taxwriter said Energy Secretary James Herrington's "outrageous" plan to restore an old tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy. Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior House Ways and Means Committee member, said Herrington's plan for a 27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5 pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year. "He must have missed the last two years of federal tax reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle," Stark said. He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an effective lower rate of U.S. tax on investment, 15 pct versus aggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct, according to a recent Congressional Research Service study.

The combined profits of Japan's major corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research Institute of Economics said. The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November. Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said. Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook, the institute said. It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved performance outlook. Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses, it said. The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88. REUTER 

Top executives with Tenneco Corp <TGT> and Sabine Corp <SAB> said they expected world oil prices to gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on imports of oil from the Middle East grows. "I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a trend of gradually increasing prices," C.W. Nance, president of Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association. Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the rate of 80 pct of capacity. The gain will come largely through increased imports to the United States, he said. "They will be able to raise the price again but I do not think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979," Nance said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected. Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20 dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in 1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988. "Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand," Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct, he said. Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability. Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20 pct during 1986, he said. "This does not mean the gas bubble is gone," Nance said. "We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three years before we start to climb out?" J.C. Walter of <Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects. "If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal," Walter said. He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel, Walter said. Reuter 

Horizon said its board and financial advisers consider the offer to be fair and reasonable and the board will unanimously recommend acceptance to its shareholders. Horizon shares jumped 23p to 188 after the announcement while Bass shares dipped 13p to 879. Bass has for some time regarded overseas holidays as an area for expansion and in pursuit of this objective, acquired a 25.6 pct holding in Horizon in 1985 when it set up the jointly owned hotel company.

China has closed the second round of bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights, the China Daily has reported. It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km. Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies. The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round. China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were terminated after no oil was discovered. Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore China since 1979. REUTER 

Heavy rains fell again in Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces. Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces. Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco. Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered. Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate. The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm. Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area. Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily. Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants. The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago. Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather. Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes. Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes, according to official figures. Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures. Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four pct a week ago. Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest. Reuter 

U.S. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for labelling changes. The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers' labels. The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods. Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue. But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University, said, "Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid." He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the blood cholesterol level. "It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease," he said. A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans. Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E. David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on labelling. "What people really have to learn is to read labels," said Kritchevsky. "The more a consumer knows, the more likely he will make an intelligent choice." The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm, palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels. Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease." Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division, said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease. The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated. David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat. Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S. soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates. U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year earlier, according to Commerce Department figures. Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier. Reuter 

Cotton planting continued progressing in the week ended April 5, but cold, wet weather in the South hampered seedbed preparation, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In a summary of its Weather and Crops Bulletin, the agency said planting increased in California as soil temperatures improved. Texas planted 10 pct compared with an average of eight pct. Arizona and Georgia planted 35 pct and two pct, respectively, it said. Oklahoma farmers prepared 10 pct of their cotton seedbeds, 15 points below average, the agency said. Reuter 

A merger at the tender price is to follow the offer, which has been approved by the Harper and Row board. Harper and Row has granted NEw Corp an option to buy up to 800,000 new shares or a 15.4 pct interest at 65 dlrs each. News Corp said if the merger agreement were terminated under certain circumstances, News would be entitled to a 16 mln dlr cash payment. Last month, Theodore Cross offered to acquire Harper and Row for 34 dlrs per share but was soon outbid by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, which offered 50 dlrs per share. Late in the month, Harper and Row said its board had received expressions of interest from a number of domestic and foreign companies. Reuter 

The White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement, industry sources said. They would give no details, noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate. There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices. U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation. The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors. Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors. In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments. The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries, and that the Japanese market remains closed. The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors. A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union. U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as televisions, video cassette recorders and computers. REUTER 

The trade show is being changed into a new international event called the World Pork Expo. The first expo will be held in June 1988 in Des Moines with an expanded format, they said. Executive vice-president Orville Sweet said the decision to spilt the show and Congress came about because there are producers who never get to see the trade show floor.

The European Community (EC) cereals trade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for sales into intervention, which it claims could save the EC budget money. It proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later. If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere, he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium. Coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution.

Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese international telecommunications company below the legal limit of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official said. In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S. Firms that have expressed interest. But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said. The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete with the current monopoly <Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said. One of the rival firms, <International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms including General Electric Co <GE>, Ford Motor Co <F> and Citibank NA <CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president Nobuo Ito said yesterday. Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second potential KDD rival, <International Digital Communications Planning Inc>, along with <C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc <PAC>, both of the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor. It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless, arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists. Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct, the ministry official said. Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless' share, industry analysts said. "Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor," Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst Darrell Whitten said. "Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up to a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an extraordinarily large holding," Whitten said. Western diplomatic sources were more blunt. "They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of strategies to reduce that share," one said. Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business organization) official who has been trying to arrange the merger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday, the ministry official said.

Automobile dealerships have become large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year. Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts say. Retail car sales "are at a point of transition. There's not much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking" about ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. The retail car market is "much more freeform now" than it was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates. Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different. Dealerships sold one kind of car--a "Chevy" or a Ford or a Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen Beatle--began to gain popularity. The "Bug" caused "a rebellion" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers, says Jauppi. One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year, the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers. "I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money," says Cole. "There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars," he says. With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up. Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D. Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by 1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800 principal owners today. Many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises, some of which might compete against each other. "It used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines," Jauppi says. As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned or open international operations. Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers, "are obviously thinking of very seriously," says Cole. Although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares. "Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars. It could happen any time," Jauppi says. "If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to resist taking them public," said another analyst. And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international. "We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks that are worldwide," he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster than the U.S., he says. "It's not totally off the wall," says Cole. Reuter 

Texas' cotton crop stands little chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in that state, as very little cotton has been planted, according to Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts. "It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pct of the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann, a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service in Austin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department. Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had begun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to begin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for 60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year, Stillmann said. Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to drop to freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio Grande Valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s, according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc. The price of new-crop cotton on the New York cotton futures market rallied today on weather-related fears. Reuter 

Cash grain dealers reported slow country movement of corn and soybeans across the Midwest, with even corn sales from PIK-and-roll activity seen earlier this week drying up. Some dealers said the USDA may further adjust the posted county price at the Gulf to take into account high barge freight rates as a way to keep corn sales flowing, but added the current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see if it will work as hoped.

Greece has agreed to buy between 27,000 and 33,000 tonnes of Spanish corn, a spokesman for Cargill's Spanish unit Compania Industrial y de Abastecimiento S.A. (CINDASA) said. He told Reuters the sale price was around 28.95 pesetas per kilo but that the final quantity and delivery date has not yet been set. The corn will be shipped in the coming days from Valencia. He said CINDASA will also ship 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes of Spanish corn to Italy in the second half of this month. The CINDASA spokesman said other corn shipments this month will include between 15,000 and 30,000 tonnes bound initially for Rotterdam and Ghent and destined for unspecified northern European countries. He said shipments of 35,000 to 50,000 tonnes of low specific gravity barley were also expected this month and added that Greece, the Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium were considering imports of Spanish flour for milling. Market sources said the corn exports, the absence of imports from the rest of the EC and the delay in shipments of corn from the U.S. Had pushed domestic corn prices up by around 0.25 pesetas a kilo today compared with yesterday.

Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth. "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said. "It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy." "It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run," he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard. The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates. REUTER 

Total supply of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date. The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury. Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said. Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a consequence prices have strengthened, the department said. Reuter 

Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.8992 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24. The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 3.8990 pct in a 31-day repurchase pact maturing on May 2, they said. The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8750 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.28/11 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit. Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be redeposited at banks after the current financial year-end today, the traders said.

Australia's crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here. He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government's economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns. Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation. Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years. These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said. The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia's relatively low exploration levels. "While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas," Evans said. He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible. As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects. APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects. Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government's desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules.

Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold, economists said. "There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is nothing for the (credit) market to get excited about," added Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc. Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods. Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln. Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the Fed's discount window for the third week running, with the latest week's borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks. While modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period, economists predicted that the Fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks. The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements. "Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressure," said Salomon's di Clemente, noting the approaching month- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates in April. "The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc, who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early April. Economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely discredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2 and M-3 aggregates. M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine, compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly M-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth. "The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures for March," said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges. In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath. Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here. "Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else," said Salomon's di Clemente, adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the U.S. economy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy's health would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary to di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first. Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when February's U.S. trade data are due for release. Reuter 

The Bank of Spain said it raised the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened money supply and inflation targets. In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said the measure would take effect from March 13. "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the statement said. Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct. The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the rate unchanged. Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987. Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February, raising government concern. Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that prices were under control. Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

Canada's real gross domestic product, seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, the same as the growth as in the previous quarter, Statistics Canada said. That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which is down from 1985's four pct increase. The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in February's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in 1987. Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in the third quarter. Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8 pct in the two previous quarters. Reuter 

Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was aimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mln dlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right." European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA <ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc <CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy. Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs. A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but gave no details. The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the CPC business. In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer <Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi was "apparently still organising finance," his company might still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business. Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630 mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid "at the date foreseen in the preliminary contract." Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in European Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by September 30. Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's European business was apparently rejected in favour of Ferruzzi's lower bid. Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said "Amylum should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case of the acquisition of CPC's European business." Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under study, he added. Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC business, Gardini said: "We do not exclude having minority partners in the CPC business." He declined to elaborate. REUTER 

Time Inc said the acquisition of Scott, Foresman and Co last year will dilute earnings per share by about 17 cts a share for the full year in 1987. For the first quarter the acquisition will have a negative impact of about 20 cts per share, chief financial officer Thayer Bigelow told security analysts. He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before depreciation and amortization for the full year. N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said Soctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987. Bigelow said the textbook business, which normally has its highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the first quarter, will have an "adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs' on book publishing income for the first quarter. "First quarter performance for the rest of Time Inc will be better than last year," Bigelow said. The dilution of 17 cts per share for 1987 includes the effects of financing the acquisition. Bigelow also said the company is "comfortable" with estimates that earnings will be between 3.75 dlrs and 4.25 dlrs per share for the year. Reuter 

West German exports to the United States fell below four billion marks worth in January for the first time since mid-1984, provisional Bundesbank data showed. The figures showed exports were 3.85 billion marks in January, sharply down from December's 4.40 billion and the lowest since the 3.56 billion exported to the U.S. In July 1984. This compared with 4.86 billion marks in January 1986. Total West German exports to Western industrialised countries also fell in January to 34.76 billion marks from December's 36.45 billion, also posting the lowest monthly total since July 1984. West German exports to the European Community were 21.60 billion marks in January, down from 22.14 billion in December and 22.94 billion in January last year, the figures showed. Exports to developing nations and centrally-planned economies also slackened. Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus of West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe because of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area. This was one of the strengths of West German exports compared with Japan, which depended in large part on the U.S., OPEC and developing country markets, it added. REUTER 

The Australia based <Ariadne Australia Ltd>, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to fulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine brewing firm, <San Miguel Corp>, a Hong Kong newspaper said. The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that <Barwon Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns a 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines. He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a total 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares. Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines. He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut Planters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only offer in cash, the newspaper reported. Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours that <Neptunia Corp>, a Hong Kong registered company which controlled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is the other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares. The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel shares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo Cojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut. Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties. The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the government. "Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines' yearly budget," Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday. Spokesmen of Ariadne, Jacksons and Neptunia were not available for comment, nor any officials of the Philippines. <San Miguel Brewery Ltd>, a Hong Kong listed company which is 69.65 pct held by Neptunia on behalf of San Miguel Corp, closed 40 cents higher at 15.50 H.K.

President Reagan has reaffirmed his opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war. "We don't want to go down that road," Reagan was quoted as telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French official expressed concern about the rising tide of protectionist sentiment in the United States. Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials "do not believe this will result in a trade war." "It is the first time that the United States has taken an action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to be alarmed about," the presidential spokesman added. "We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a trade war," he said. Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the Japanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill "an agreement to make some corrections." Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congress and the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, he said, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act." Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was "well considered by this administration and not taken lightly." While the White House official held open the possibility that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, he indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head off the sanctions. "We are always open to negotations ... Whether it (a settlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions) from going into effect is questionable at this point," the spokesman said. The sanctions take effect in mid-April. REUTER 

TWA said, however, that if the negotiated deal is not acceptable it may make an offer directly to USAir's shareholders for up to 51 pct of USAir's outstanding stock, to be purchased in a voting trust at a price lower than today's offer. TWA said it is filing an application with the Department of Transportation seeking approval of the merger as well as an application for approval, on an expedited basis, of its purchase of up to 51 pct of USAir common and the deposit of the stock in a voting trust, pending DOT approval.

Treasury Secretary James Baker said there has been no change in U.S. policy on the value of the dollar. Baker, when asked if the policy was changed in view of comments yesterday by a senior Commerce Department official who said he thought the Japanese yen was undervalued against the dollar by 10 to 15 pct, replied, "No." Yesterday Robert Ortner, Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, said he thought the yen was undervalued but said that was his personal view. This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at about the right level to reflect underlying economic conditions. Baker, who spoke earlier to the National Newspaper Association, declined to elaborate on his statement about U.S. policy. Reuter 

Silver looks "unlikely to break out of gold and platinum's shadow" in the near future, although this year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than supply, a study by Credit Suisse said. The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200 tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to 14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850 tonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes. The study noted that the effects of last year's lower prices were having a dampening effect on total supply, which was now back down to around levels of a decade ago. However, the study said that primary production, likely to reach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in 1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls. Around a third of silver production comes from heavily indebted Mexico and Peru. Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the majority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.

ChemLawn Corp said its board rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares. ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value. ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill," during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other purchasers. ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and other relief. The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules. Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs. ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders, and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees, suppliers, creditors, and customers. "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their shares to Waste Management," said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen. ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect shareholders against abusive tactics, such as "market accumulations by Waste Management or others." Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn common. ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board. It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time prior to their exercise date. ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer. It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record March 20. Reuter 

The Soviet Union has been a heavy buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade. Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U.S. official. In a report dated March 10, the official said that about 800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June. An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said. Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said. Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier estimates of 150,000, the official said. The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year, he said. Reuter 

Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987 and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal Institute of Technology said in its spring review. It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988 compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct. The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more difficult international economic climate facing export industry. The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5 pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7 pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review. Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986. Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from 2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct. The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure on Swiss exporters. It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct. Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2 pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986. REUTER 

Dealers saw the dollar staying at current levels but possibly rising above 1.83 marks on any supporting remarks emerging from the meetings. "But the dollar's medium-term direction is soft," one dealer said. The dollar could well come under renewed pressure after the international forums as attention returned to the U.S. And the U.K.'s trade dispute with Japan, dealers said. Cross currency trading was also subdued though sterling's rise above 1.60 dlrs helped it to firm against the mark. It was fixed higher at 2.924 marks after yesterday's 2.910. The pound was seen staying between 2.90 and 2.93 marks for the next days, dealers said. Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from this morning, with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-11/16 pct. Six month euromarks stayed at midpoint 3-7/8 pct. The Swiss franc firmed to 119.86 marks per 100 at the fix from 119.71 yesterday and the yen rose to 1.244 marks per 100 from 1.243.

Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower intervention price (or the upper intervention price), the reference price will be automatically revised downwards (or upwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents. 4) The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn last night, setting the stage for compromise. Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on March 20. The current conference was widely seen as the last chance to clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new five- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in October over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock. The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Britain are the major consumers. UNCTAD's latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in rubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988.

A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a proposed merger with Baker International Corp <BKO>, Wall Street analysts said. Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said it was still interested in the merger. The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its troubles could make it a takeover candidate. There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters he is not interested. Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the target other than to rule out Hughes. One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp <BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker. Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile, analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going. "I think the merger is not going through," said Phil Pace, analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger "lost a lot of its appeal" when the U.S. Department of Justice required that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation. Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said "30 to 40 pct of the cost savings are tied up in that." "They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit," said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position, I don't know. "It's getting a little confusing," said James Carroll, analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "tend to be weak." Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22, the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer period of time. Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale. Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs. Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed "the outlook for the industry has improved materially." Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting.

The European Community (EC) and Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because of Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC, delegates said. Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC delegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session: "We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting." Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC. Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: "We wanted the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no." A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work. Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon. Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: "We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not on all questions." Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community, he replied: "This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented." West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement. The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January. The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC. REUTER 

There is a slightly better than even chance that the Federal Reserve will enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary reserves, economists said.

Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would find a new suitor for the company, traders said. Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265 mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of its Purolator courier division's management. The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one. Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10. The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier division. "Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has 450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs," said Gardner in a telephone interview with Reuters. Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he personally owns 20,000 shares. A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from Gardner. Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor. While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again. "There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question of management's willingness to let the process continue," said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction. Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S. courier operations. The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in Purolator. "As far as I can tell from the public documents from the deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero. One always likes a situation like that. You always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher," said one arbitrager. The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position. While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some risk to the firm. "There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash, and all sorts of things that make it very speculative," said one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to employees. The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs in so-called "bridge" financing for the transaction. The bridge financing is a temporary loan from Hutton. The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing, expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm. Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale. "It's a very complex transaction, but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place," Gardner said.

(General Partners), a Texas general partnership equally owned by affiliates of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc <AFG>, said it currently holds 2,180,608 common shares, or about 9.8 pct, of Gencorp Inc's <GY> outstanding common stock. General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash tender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern, that is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs. Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making, aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding. The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of financing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions. In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A. William Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to meet as soon as possible. In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed 250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co <WFC> and a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, a unit of American Express Co <AXP>. A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He said he was not sure the company had formally received notice of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts. He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or whether it would issue a statement later today. In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment. The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes over license renewals at several of its television stations. Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles. General Partners officials were not immediately available. Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high. The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest, the partnership said. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in the tender offer, it said. In the letter, the partnership said it was confident it could obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly. Last fall AFG and privately held Wagner and Brown offered to acquired (Lear Siegler Inc) for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged. Lear Siegler eventually went private for about 1.66 billion dlrs. Reuter 

Brazilian crude oil and liquefied natural gas production fell to an average 583,747 barrels per day in February from 596,740 in the same 1986 month, the state oil company Petrobras said. The drop was due to operating problems in the Campos Basin, the country's main producing area, where output was down to 346,011 bpd from 357,420, a Petrobras statement said. Consumption of oil derivatives totalled 1.14 mln bpd in February, 16.7 pct up on February last year but down from the record 1.22 mln bpd used in October last year. Use of alcohol fuel in February was 208,600 bpd, 42 pct above February, 1986. Reuter 

Uncertainty is growing about the prospects for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro Association said. Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said in a report. However, last month's agreement among the six leading western industrialized countries to keep currencies around present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for exporters, it added. The banking association said the possibility of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be overestimated. Another small drop in already low interest rates could not be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of consumer or capital goods, it said. The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for any further monetary moves, the association added. On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the third quarter. The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively weak. Bank economists have forecast the economy will either stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official first-quarter figures are due in early June. REUTER 

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said. At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors. Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets. In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. <ABNN.AS> chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar. Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said. Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently. He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said. He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off. REUTER 

Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share, reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to change the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant revenues. The accounting change will not affect the company's cash position and the company intends to continue paying its dividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share. Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or 2.60 dlrs per share. Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by delays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities Commission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate relief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing units one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project. It said the commission is currently allowing the company to recover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants. As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month as deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been included in current income. But the accounting change, effective January 1, will reflect only cash received through interim rates approved by the commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said. It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public Staff Division's report which will recommend how much of the 5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to recover in rates. The company further stated that it is confident it will receive an objective review of the facts. It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates. Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power units in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one went into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in March last year.

The death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they said. The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers. "For many third world nations, the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources," said Delfin Ganapin, a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact. "In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest, now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious," he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result, the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. "No replanting programme has been successful," said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks, the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests, and nations must be educated in how best to "farm" them, said Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop and produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank, Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84, only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said. WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining, up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers. REUTER 

Thai coffee exporters said they hoped the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in world prices. Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only about 30 pct of its total annual exports. Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who offer higher prices than non-members, he said. The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985. Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000 tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the previous year. However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices. Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market, further depressing prices. He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial amount of coffee this month without such restrictions. REUTER 

In 1986, Emhart reported a net loss of 10 mln dlrs or 35 cts a share, after a 90 mln after-tax restructuring charge, which realigned the company's assets. Emhart has divested itself of many of its units to focus on three primary markets--industrial products, consumer products, and information and electronic systems.

A meeting of leading politicians, bankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross domestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5 pct, a government spokesman said. This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the semi-official Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) last December. Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, told Reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting attended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina, National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative. Economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently mainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this year, notably to Eastern Europe and oil exporting states. Hannes Androsch, general director of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI>, today put 1987 GDP growth at between one and 1.5 pct. Kramer also said the meeting had heard that unemployment for the year would be above the 5.5 pct forecast, but was unlikely to be more than six pct. REUTER 

U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain, the Labor Department said. The CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) rose to 329.0 in February, the department said. Prices for petroleum-based energy rose sharply for a second consecutive month during February but by less than in January, the department said. Energy prices rose 1.9 pct last month after a 3.0 pct rise in January, accounting for one-third of the overall CPI rise. For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an unadjusted 2.1 pct. Transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct increase in January. Smaller price rises for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges were responsible for the moderation. Gasoline prices rose 4.2 pct last month after increasing 6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a year ago, the department said. Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices. Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after increasing 9.8 pct in January, but were still 15 pct below price levels of February 1986. Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January increase. Grocery store food prices were up 0.4 pct, the same as in January, but meat, poultry, fish and eggs cost less for a third consecutive month, the department said. Medical care rose 0.3 pct in February to a level 7.1 pct above one year ago, because of higher costs for prescription and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies, the department said. The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly men's clothing, was responsible for the advance. Prices for other goods and services rose 0.7 pct in February following a 1.1 pct increase in January. Tobacco prices, up 0.9 pct after a 2.0 pct January increase, accounted for 30 pct of the index rise, the department said. Reuter 

Indonesia cannot spend its way out of recession and has very limited economic options due to lower world oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency. "If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might create negative effects not only on price increases, but also on the balance of payments," he told bankers and businessmen in the North Sumatran city of Medan. Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its export drive to help narrow its trade deficit. Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries, which are centered in Sumatra. "I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation sector in which family units are employed in great number," he said, according to the agency. Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its export revenue until last year's fall in crude prices.

The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza," he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg," said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

The European Community (EC) delivered warnings to both Japan and the United States over trade frictions which have hit relations between the Community and its main trading partners. EC foreign ministers meeting here issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for greater effort by the country to open its markets. Ministers also issued a statement saying they were disturbed by moves in the U.S. to limit imports of textiles and warned that the Community would react to any such moves. EC External Trade Commissioner, Willy De Clercq has already written to his U.S. counterpart, special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns. The ministers' said they were "very disturbed" by the U.S. moves, adding, "the adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations." Any unilateral U.S. moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the world trade body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade ... (and) expect Japan to open up its market more." The statement added that the EC continued to insist that the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate demand. Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take action where necessary. One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. "It wil be back on the table again and again," the diplomat said. De Clercq told journalists, "There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations with Japan." But diplomats said the Community is keen to continue talking with Tokyo to try and solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war. Reuter 

The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be enough to buy the company, analysts said. Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses. Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading. "The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's cooperation," said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton group. Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years, were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions. "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation," said Baker of the offer. Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction. A source close to General Partners, however, said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations. The source said if approved, the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out. If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved. General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc. Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell the stations. GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV. Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station's license. GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs. General Partners said it intends to keep the company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment. Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting, including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share, he said. The company, formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share, he said. Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp, founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve. "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said. Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but they declined to predict what steps the company might take. They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer. General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there was some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock. "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing surprises me anymore," said Rose. GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers. Reuter 

First City Bancorp of Texas, which lost a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it expected operating losses to continue "for the foreseeable future" as it continues to search for additional capital or a merger partner. The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received a qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co. The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City eventually obtaining additional capital. "The company believes that in order to address its long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of operations, it will ultimately need several hundred million dollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more strongly capitalized entity," First City said in a note to its financial statements included in the annual report. "Management believes that sufficient resources should be available to cover interim capital concerns while additional capital is being sought," the bank said. To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell or mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of its member banks. "The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less than in 1986," First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter included in the annual report. "However, the ultimate return to satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the successful resolution of the related problems of credit quality, funding and the eventual need for substantial additional capital." First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid default. The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120 mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks. Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986, First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of 5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio. Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate prices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs last year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of 1986. First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion dlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs "should be more modest." The amount represented 15 pct of First City's total loans. In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end. Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine pct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount could go higher. "The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio so long as the regional recession persists," First City said. "Because the carrying value of many of these loans is collateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of real estate-related chargeoffs."

Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with high-level officials that will include talks on the growing trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products. He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a pact on microchip trade signed last September. Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the trip is set for April 6 to 8. U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each year at this time, she told reporters. The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on U.S.-Japanese foreign aid programs and political security issues of mutual concern, she added. "Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is expected, the talks are not directly related to U.S.-Japanese trade relations," she insisted. But, in response to questions, Oakley acknowledged that trade will be discussed. Japan's 58.6 billion dlrs trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress, which is concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. Trade deficit in 1986.

American Telephone and Telegraph Co does not plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a share on its common stock, said James E. Olson, chairman. "It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so that it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the business cycle," Olson told a meeting of securities analysts. "We see no reason to change that policy," he said. Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson said the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid in dividends by increasing earnings. Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its common dividend, especially after the company posted a fourth quarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five cts a share for the full year. The loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7 billion dlrs. Olson said he expects ATT's cash flow to remain strong despite the poor earnings. Reuter 

French gross domestic product should grow by 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pct in 1986, the Finance Ministry said. The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year and 14.7 in 1986. The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1 pct last year. In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said. Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this year and next after last year's 0.5 billion surplus, it added. Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986. Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8 pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct this year but less than last year's 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise in household consumption, compared with this year's 1.5 pct and last year's 2.9 pct. Business investment is forecast to rise four pct a year this year and next after 3.7 pct last year, with private sector productive investment rising 4.9 pct in 1988 after a six pct rise this year and 5.5 pct in 1986. The Ministry said updated forecasts would be prepared before the autumn to serve as the basis for the 1988 budget, which the government is now preparing for presentation in September. REUTER 

Petroleos de Venezuela S.A will announce within two weeks the name of a foreign consortium it has chosen to help exploit the coal deposits at Guasare in western Zulia state, PDVSA president Juan Chacin Guzman said. Chacin told reporters the foreign partner will provide capital as well as technical and marketing expertise to the Carbozulia project, which the state oil company will manage. PDVSA officials said that among those who bid for the partnership is a consortium between Agip Carbone, a subsidiary of Italy's Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI), and Atlantic Richfield <ARC> of the United States. Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said discussions are currently taking place to finalize the terms of the contract with the foreign partner. PDVSA vice-president Pablo Reimpell said last week the first shipment of coal from the Carbozulia project should be made during the final quarter of 1987, and would measure between 100-150,000 metric tons. Plans call for production to eventually reach 500,000 mt annually. Reimpell said the original investment in the project will be approximately 8 billion bolivars. Reuter 

The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters. He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise. Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S. Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little changed from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. "We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet," he added. Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said. The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said. The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when his current term expires later this year. "He's a great man," the official said, adding that more and more people expect his reappointment. Turning to exchange rates, the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so far it has not been very strong, he said. REUTER 

Pearson Plc <PSON.L> said the recent sale of its Fairey Engineering companies, in a 51.5 mln stg management buy-out, was part of its policy of concentrating on four key sectors. In a statement with its 1986 results, the company said its information and entertainments sector's Financial Times, FT, newspaper had record sales and profits. The FT is subject to a 70 mln stg investment programme, with the printing and publishing operation moving to a new plant in the London docklands next year. Its other key sectors are merchant banking, oil and china. Commenting on its Camco Inc oil service subsidiary, Pearson said it believes the oil business setback is only temporary. The group has been acquiring oil properties in both the U.S. And Britain which will begin to make a significant impact on profits in the 1990s. Far East operations of fine china subsidiary Royal Doulton Ltd are being expanded in the wake of record recent sales in Japan, it added. Pearson reported 1986 pre-tax profit of 121.1 mln stg, up from 109.3 mln in 1985. Turnover fell to 953 mln from 970 mln. REUTER 

Grain analysts said the increase of three mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely to affect the market Tuesday. They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet imports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought one mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program. In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimate for 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln. "That was business already done, for all practical purposes," said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson, reflecting similar statements made by other analysts. Reuter 

Extracts from a report by Italy's Budget Ministry on the country's economic development in 1986 showed gross domestic product (GDP) 2.7 pct higher in real terms than in 1985 but a rise in unemployment. GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire last year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices basis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in 1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985. But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the ministry said. The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries such as Italy. These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3 pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985. They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance. On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986 of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a previous deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and compares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985. Reuter 
